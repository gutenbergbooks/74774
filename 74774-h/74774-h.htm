<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="sc">This</span> book was originally intended to be
an account of the people and mountains of Air in the Central
Sahara, where I made a journey during most of 1922 with Angus
Buchanan and T. A. Glover. The former had visited the area on a
previous occasion and had described the people and places he had
seen in his book, <em>Out of the World—North of Nigeria</em>. It
therefore seemed more profitable to inquire into some of the
problems surrounding the inhabitants of the Sahara whom we
encountered, and thus deal with Air and its Tuareg population
rather less objectively than had my fellow-traveller. In the course
of the succeeding years, as I became more and more immersed in
considering various scientific aspects of the Sahara, I came to the
conclusion that neither had the Tuareg people nor had this vast
area of the earth’s surface been at all adequately examined. Most
studies had been objective and, as is unhappily the case with this
book, confined to one area. A comprehensive account of the history
and ethnology of the Sahara still requires to be written.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these investigations, the present work
assumed a form for which one journey of nine months in the
countries concerned scarcely seems enough justification. That the
book was not completed sooner has been due to the impossibility of
spending any time continuously either in research or on writing
during the three years which have elapsed since I returned. The
fact that this book has been the occupation only of such spare time
as I have had available accounts for its many conscious
deficiencies, which are unfortunately not the more
excusable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> in a volume
of the type which it purports to be. If I can feel that it will
have served to stimulate the curiosity of students or have assisted
them to find their way about the literature on the subject, I shall
consider that as a reward calculated to enhance the pleasure which
I have derived from writing and reading about this—to
me—fascinating topic.</p>
<p>It will be one of my lasting regrets that I was unable to
complete with Angus Buchanan his journey across the Sahara from
Nigeria to Algiers. The delays which we encountered in Air obliged
me to return to resume my duties in that branch of H.M.’s Service
in which I was then serving. This is not the place to mention the
many things which I owe to Angus Buchanan; perhaps the greatest
advantage I derived was the promise we gave one another to travel
again together if an occasion should come to him and leisure from
another profession to me, whereby we might be enabled to renew our
companionship of the road. I am grateful to him for permission to
use several of his photographs in the present volume as well as
certain information which he collected when we were separately
engaged on our different work.</p>
<p>To T. A. Glover, the Cinematographer, whose services Angus
Buchanan secured to accompany him, I owe many pleasant memories of
days spent together and his excellent advice in taking most of the
photographs which are included in this book.</p>
<p>The French officers whom I encountered in the course of my
wanderings were as charming and as friendly as perhaps, of all
foreign nations, only Frenchmen know how to be. Were the relations
between our respective countries always even remotely similar to
those which subsisted between us, there would be no room for the
suspicion and pettiness which so often mar diplomatic and political
intercourse. The mutual confidence in which we lived is illustrated
by two events.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion in Air when news was received<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> of a raid being about to fall
on the country, I was honoured by receiving a communication from
the French officer commanding the Fort at Agades, indicating the
locality in his general scheme of defence whither I might lead on a
reconnaissance an armed band of local Tuareg from the village in
which I was then living by myself. On another occasion, after
travelling for some hundreds of miles with a French Camel Corps
patrol, the men were paraded and in their presence I was nominated
an honorary serjeant of the “Peloton Méhariste de Guré,” a type of
compliment which those associated with the French Army will best
realise. It is to the officer commanding this unit, Henri Gramain
of the French Colonial Army, that I owe the most perfect
companionship I have ever had the fortune to experience. I know
that when we meet again we shall resume conversation where we left
off at Teshkar in the bushland of Elakkos, one evening in the
summer of 1922. He and my other friends, Tuareg, British, French,
Arab and Fulani contributed to make that year the happiest I have
ever spent.</p>
<p>No reader of the works of that great traveller, Dr. Heinrich
Barth, will need to be told how much of the data collected in the
succeeding pages has been culled from the monumental account of his
<em>Travels in Central Africa</em>. This German, who most loyally
served the British Crown in those far countries, is perhaps the
greatest traveller there has ever been in Africa. His exploits were
never advertised, so his fame has not been suffered to compete with
the more sensational and journalistic enterprises accomplished
since his day down to modern times. But no student will require to
have his praises sung by any disciple.</p>
<p>I have to thank the Royal Geographical Society for permission to
use the map which was prepared for a paper I had the honour to read
in 1923 before a meeting of the Fellows. More especially do I wish
to thank E. A. Reeves, their Keeper of Maps, both for the
instruction in surveying<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_viii">[viii]</span> which he gave me before my journey and
for the assistance afforded after my return in checking and working
up my results. My cartographic material in the form of road
traverses, sketch maps based on astronomical positions, and
theodolite computations are all in the Society’s library and
available to students. A small collection of ethnographic material
which I brought back is at Oxford in the Pitt Rivers Museum, to
whose Curator, Henry Balfour, I am indebted both for advice and for
plates Nos. 24-26, 37 and 42.</p>
<p>H. R. Palmer, now H.M. Lieutenant-Governor of Northern Nigeria,
and Messrs. Macmillan & Co. have given me permission to use a table
of the Kings of Agades incorporated as Appendix VI. The list
originally appeared <em>in extenso</em>, with the names somewhat
differently spelled, in an article which he published in the
<em>Journal of the African Society</em> in July 1910. The great
learning and sympathetic help which he was good enough to put at my
disposal have made me, in common with many others in Nigeria, in
whose friendship my journey so richly rewarded me, hope that he may
be induced to render more accessible to the public the immense fund
of historical and other material which he has accumulated during
his long career as a distinguished Colonial servant.</p>
<p>The then Governor of Nigeria, Sir H. Clifford, and the French
Ministry of Colonies earned the gratitude of Angus Buchanan and
myself by their assistance on the road and in facilitating our
journey.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law, T. A. Emmet, was good enough to execute
several drawings from rough sketches I had made on the spot. Two of
these drawings are reproduced as plates Nos. 38 and 39.</p>
<p>To three persons it is difficult for me to express my gratitude
at all suitably. D. G. Hogarth read my manuscript and offered his
invaluable advice regarding the final form of the book as it now
appears. Many years’ association with him has led others beside
myself to regard him in his wisdom as our spiritual godfather in
things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span> appertaining
to the world of Islam. My father devoted many days and nights to
correcting the final draft and proofs of this book. My brother
Peter, when his versatile mind perceived certain improvements,
rewrote Chapter XII after I had become so tired of the sight of my
manuscript that I was on the verge of destroying the offensive
object. I owe more to both these two than I can explain.</p>

<p class="less"><span class="sc">The</span> general map at the end
of the volume was prepared by the Royal Geographical Society from
data collected by the author supplementing existing maps published
in France and described in the text of the book. The two drawings
(Plates 38 and 39) were executed in England by T. A. Emmet from
sketches made in Air. Plates Nos. 2, 15 (lower), 34 are from

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>NOTE</h2>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> name “Air” is a dissyllable word:
the vowels are pronounced as in Italian according to the general
system of transliteration, which follows, wherever possible, the
rules laid down by the Committee of the Royal Geographical Society
on the Spelling of Proper Names. In the Tuareg form of Berber,
<em>t</em> before <em>i</em> or similar vowel, especially in the
feminine possessive particle “tin,” very often assumes a sound
varying between a hard explosive <em>tch</em> and a soft liquid
dental, such as is found in the English word “tune.” This
modification of the sound <em>t</em> is written <em>t’</em>,
wherever it is by usage sufficiently pronounced to be noticeable.
The pronunciation of Tuareg words follows the Air dialect, which
often differs from the northern speech. Letters are only accented
where it is important to avoid mispronunciation, as in Fadé and
Emilía: a final <em>e</em>, as in Assode, which is a trisyllable,
should always be pronounced even if not accented.</p>
<p>The nasal <em>n</em> occurring in such words as Añastafidet is
written <em>ñ</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>gh</em> (or Arabic غ, <em>ghen</em>) sound is, as in
other Berber languages, very common in the speech of the Tuareg.
The letter is so strongly <em>grasseyé</em> as to be
indistinguishable, in many cases, from <em>r</em>. The French with
greater logic write this sound <em>r</em> or <em>r’</em>. Doubtless
many names which have been spelled with <em>r</em> in the
succeeding pages should more correctly have been spelled with
<em>gh</em>: such mistakes are due to the difficulties both of
distinguishing the sound in speech, and of transcribing French
transliterations.</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to indicate the occurrence of the third
<em>g</em> which exists in the Tuareg alphabet, in addition to the
hard <em>g</em> and the soft <em>g</em> (written <em>j</em>).</p>
<p>The Arabic letter ع (<em>’ain</em>) does not exist in the speech
of the Tuareg; where they use an Arabic word containing this
letter, they substitute for it the sound <em>gh</em>.</p>
<p>No signs have been used to distinguish between the hard and soft
varieties of the letters <em>d</em>, <em>t</em> and <em>z</em>. The
“kef” (Iek) and “qaf” (Iaq) sounds are written <em>k</em> and
<em>q</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nopb"><a id="c01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p class="sch">INTRODUCTORY</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sahara</span> is the name given in modern
geography to the whole of the interior of North Africa between the
Nile Valley and the Atlantic littoral, south of the Mediterranean
coastlands and north of the Equatorial belt. The word “Sahara” is
derived from the Arabic, and its meaning refers to a certain type
of stony desert in one particular area. There is no native name for
the whole of this vast land surface: it is far too large to fall
wholly within the cognisance of any one group of its diverse
inhabitants. The fact that it is a Moslem area and sharply
distinguished from the rest of Africa has made it desirable to find
a better name than “Sahara” to include both the interior and the
littoral, for even “Sahara,” unsatisfactory as it is, can only be
used of the former. “Africa Minor” has been proposed, but the
reception accorded to this name has not been so cordial as to
warrant its use. The clumsy term “North Africa” must therefore
serve in the following pages to describe all the northern part of
the continent; specifically it refers to the parts west of the Nile
Valley and north of the Sudan.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is an area which is now
no longer permanently inhabited<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_2">[2]</span> by negro races, and which is not covered by the
dense vegetation of Equatoria.</p>
<p>To the general public the name Sahara denotes “Desert,” and the
latter connotes sand and thirst and camels and picturesque men and
veiled women. The Sahara in reality is very different. Its surface
and races are varied. Almost every type of physical feature, except
permanent glaciation, can be found. The greater part is capable of
supporting animal and vegetable life in some degree. Absolute
desert where no living thing can exist does not on the whole form a
very large proportion of the surface. It has become usual nowadays
to differentiate between the cultivated or cultivable areas, the
steppe desert and the true desert. The latter alone is devoid of
organic life, and is the exception rather than the rule. The
mountain groups of the Sahara fall, as an intermediate category,
between the cultivated and the desert lands. Generally speaking,
animal and vegetable life exist in the valleys, where some tillage
is often possible. The density of population, however, is never
comparable with that of the cultivated districts, which, except
where they fringe the coast, are usually included in the term
“oases.”</p>
<p>The mountain groups of the Sahara are numerous and comparatively
high. There are summits in the more important massifs exceeding
10,000 feet above the sea. The three most important groups in the
Central Sahara are the Tibesti, Air and Ahaggar mountains. In such
a generalisation, reference to the Atlas and other mountain masses
in Algeria and Morocco may be omitted, since they do not properly
speaking belong to the Sahara. The three Saharan massifs are
probably of volcanic origin. They have only become known in recent
years, and even now have not been fully explored. This is
especially the case in regard to Tibesti, an area believed to be
orographically connected with Air by the almost unknown plateau of
the Southern Fezzan.</p>
<p>The Central Sahara with these three groups of mountains differs
materially from the Eastern Sahara. Although our<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> data for the latter are more
limited by lack of knowledge, the structure of the surface
immediately west of the Nile Valley appears characteristically to
be a series of closed basins. The area is covered with depressions
into which insignificant channels flow, and from which there appear
to be no outlets. Compared with the river systems of the west, the
stream beds are small and ill-defined. One valley of some
magnitude, the Bahr Bela Ma which Rohlfs tried to find on his
famous journeys in the Libyan desert, has been identified either as
a dry channel of the Nile running roughly parallel to it, or
alternatively as a valley which starts from N.E. Tibesti and
terminates near or in the Wadi Natrun depression just west of the
Nile and level with the apex of the Delta. The upper part which
drains Tibesti has been called the W. Fardi; elsewhere it is the W.
Fareg; the shallow depression crossed by Hassanein Bey on his
journey from Jalo to Kufra seems to be part of this system.
Examples of closed basins separated from one another by steppe or
desert are the oases of Kufra, the Jaghbub-Siwa, Jalo and Lake Chad
depressions. In these areas cultivation is frequently intense; salt
and fresh water are abundant; and the vegetation sometimes develops
luxuriantly into veritable forests of date palms such as exist at
Kufra. Between these hollows the intervening Libyan desert is
probably the largest and most sterile area of its sort in the
world.</p>
<p>The Western Sahara, on the other hand, is essentially an area of
well-defined river systems with watersheds and dry beds fashioned
on a vast scale. The valleys which extend from the mountains of
Ahaggar and the Fezzan to the present River Niger have
corresponding channels on the other side of the water-parting
running through Southern Algeria or Tunisia towards the
Mediterranean. There are good reasons for believing that the
original course of the Niger terminated in a swamp or marsh north
of Timbuctoo, probably the same collecting basin as that west of
Ahaggar into which certain rivers from the Atlas also used to flow.
The lower Niger from the eastern side of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_4">[4]</span> the great bend where the river now turns
south-east and south drained the Central Sahara by a great channel
which had its head-waters in Ahaggar and the Fezzan, and ran west
of Air.</p>
<p>These Saharan rivers have not contained perennial surface water
for long ages. In places they have been covered by more recent
sand-dune formations of great extension, but they date from the
present geological period. Associated with the desiccation of these
valleys is the characteristic of extreme dryness which is one of
the few features more or less in accord with popular conceptions of
the Sahara. The barrenness of the Sahara is less due to the
inherent sterility of the ground than to climatic conditions;
desiccation has been intensified in the course of centuries by the
purely mechanical processes attendant upon an extremely continental
climate and excessively high day temperatures. The latter combined
with the extraordinary dryness of the air have contributed to the
decay of vegetable, and consequently of animal, life wherever man
has not been sufficiently powerful, in numbers or energy, to stay
the process. Sterility and desiccation are interacting causes and
effects. There is no reason to believe that any sudden change of
climate has taken place in the Sahara since the neolithic period,
or that it is very much drier now than two thousand years ago.
Maximum and minimum temperatures, both average and absolute, have a
very wide range seasonally and within the period of twenty-four
hours. Temperatures of over 100° F. in the shade are common at all
seasons of the year during the day: the thermometer frequently
falls to freezing point at night during the winter. Ice is not
unknown in the mountains of Tibesti, Air and Ahaggar. The rainfall
is irregular except within the belt of summer rains which are so
characteristic of Equatorial Africa. In Tibesti the cycle of good
rains seems to recur once in thirteen years: in many years both
here and elsewhere in the Sahara no rain falls at all. But with
these adverse climatic conditions the surprising fact remains, not
that the Sahara is so barren, but that it is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_5">[5]</span> so relatively well-favoured and capable of
supporting different races of people in such comparatively large
numbers.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p>The Air mountains, like the Desert steppes, are only sparsely
inhabited. The hill-sides are too wind-swept and rocky to support
forests or pastures of any value. Many of the valleys are capable
of being cultivated, but in practice are only gardened here and
there. In certain districts there are groves of date palms which
have been imported from the north. Air is in reality a great
Saharan oasis divided from the Equatorial belt by a zone of desert
and steppe. It differs from the south in its flora and general
conditions, though by its position within the belt of tropical
summer rains it belongs climatically to the Sudan.</p>

<p>The oases of the desert, like the Sahara generally, have been
the subject of much popular misconception. The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_6">[6]</span> origin of the word “oasis,” which has
reached us in its present form through the classics, may perhaps be
found in ancient Egyptian. It seems to be connected with the name
of the Wawat People of the West referred to in the Harris
Papyrus,<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> and occurs in the names of Wau el Kebir and Wau
el Seghir or el Namus, which are oases in the Eastern Fezzan.<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
term El Wahat,<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> given to one or several of the oases west of the
Nile Valley, contains the same root. An oasis is not necessarily a
patch of ground with two or three palm trees and a well in the
desert. It is simply an indefinite area of fertility in a barren
land; it may or may not happen to have a well. There are oases in
Southern Algeria and the Fezzan with hundreds of thousands of palm
trees, containing many villages and a permanent population. There
are others where the pasture is good but where there is neither
population nor water. “Oasis” is a term with no strict denotation,
it connotes attributes which render animal life possible.</p>
<p>In this sense Air, as a whole, is an oasis situated on a great
caravan road from the Mediterranean to Central Africa. The
mountains so lie in respect of the desert to the north and to the
south that caravan journeys may be broken in their valleys, and
camels can stay to recuperate. The mountains mark a stage on the
road, the importance of which it is difficult to over-estimate. In
the history of North Africa, the principal routes across the Sahara
from the Mediterranean to the Sudan have seemingly not changed at
all. Since the earliest times they have followed the shortest
tracks from north to south whenever there was sufficient water. If
the Nile Valley and the routes in the desert adjacent thereto are
left out of account as being <em>suorum generum</em>, there are
four main caravan roads across North Africa from north to south.
The easternmost runs from Cyrenaica by Kufra<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_7">[7]</span> to Wadai and Tibesti; only within the last
century has it been rendered practicable for caravans by the
provision of wells along the southern part, which was opened to
heavy traffic by the Senussiya sect. The two central routes run
respectively from Tripolitania by the Fezzan, Murzuk and Kawar to
Lake Chad, and by Ghadames, Ghat and Air to the Central Sudan. The
western route runs from Algeria and Morocco across the desert to
Timbuctoo. In addition there is the Moroccan road, which roughly
follows the curve of the coast to the Western Sudan and Senegal. Of
all these the best known in modern times,<a id=
"FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
culturally perhaps the most important, has been the Air road. It is
noteworthy that all three central routes have been or are within
the control of the Tuareg race. As the Tuareg were the caravan
drivers of the Central Sahara, so were they also responsible for
bringing a certain degree of civilisation from the Mediterranean to
Equatorial Africa. That has been their greatest rôle in
history.</p>
<p>The object of this book is to describe a part of the Tuareg
race, namely, those tribes which live in Air and in the country
immediately to the south. It will not be possible to examine in any
detail the theories surrounding the origin of the race, but certain
definitions are necessary if the succeeding chapters are to be
understood. The Berbers of North Africa, among whom are usually
included the Tuareg, have very disputed origins; for many reasons
it is perhaps best to follow the example of Herodotus and use the
geographical term Libyans for them. Less controversy surrounds this
name than “Berber,” which implies a number of wholly imaginary
anthropological connections. Moreover, it is even open to doubt
whether the Tuareg are Berbers at all, like the other people so
called in Algeria and Morocco. In all this confusion it will be
enough to grasp that the Tuareg are a Libyan people with marked
individual peculiarities and that they were in North Africa long
before the Arabs came. They have been there ever since the earliest
times of which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> have
any historical record, though in more northern areas than those
which they now occupy. The population of the Sahara is very diverse
and the affinities of the various elements afford many interesting
problems for study; but in the present work we shall be concerned
with the one race alone.</p>
<p>The Tuareg country may roughly be described as extending from
the eastern edge of the Central Sahara, which is bounded by the
Fezzan-Murzuk-Kawar-Lake Chad caravan road, to the far edge of the
western deserts of North Africa before the Atlantic zone begins,
and from Southern Algeria in the north to the Niger and the
Equatorial belt between the river and Lake Chad in the south. The
Tuareg are so little known even to-day that their very existence is
almost legendary. It is with something of a thrill that the tourist
in Tunis or Algiers learns from a mendacious guide that a poor Arab
half-caste sitting muffled in a cloak is one of the fabled People
of the Veil. It is long, in fact, since any of them have visited
the Mediterranean coast, for they do not care for Europeans very
much. Before the Italo-Turkish War, occasional Tuareg used to reach
the coast at Tripoli at the end of the long caravan road from
Central Africa; even then they more usually stopped at Ghadames or
Murzuk. With the Italian occupation of Tripolitania in 1913 they
became apprehensive of intrusion on their last unconquered area;
but despite the Italian failure to occupy and administer the
interior they have only lately ventured a certain way north once
more on raids or for commerce.</p>
<p>Though the Hornemann, Lyons and the Denham, Oudney and
Clapperton expeditions in the first half of the last century
touched the fringe of the Tuareg country, the first Europeans in
modern times to come into contact with the Azger group in the
Fezzan were Richardson in 1847 and Barth with Richardson in 1849
and subsequent years. Barth, more particularly mentioned in the
story of the penetration of Air, is in some respects even now the
most valuable authority for all the Tuareg except the Ahaggaren.
The first detailed work of value dedicated to the latter was that
of Duveyrier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> <em>Les
Touareg du Nord</em>, published in 1864 after a journey through the
Ahaggar and Azger country and the Fezzan. His systematic study of
the ethnology of the Tuareg, his geographical work and his
researches into the fauna, flora and ancient history of the lands
he visited, were presented to the world in a form which has since
been taken in France as the model of what a scientific book should
be. Ill health was the tragedy of his life, for it prevented his
return, and rendered him, as he remarked in later years, “an
arm-chair explorer of the Sahara.” After visiting the Wad Righ and
Shott countries in Southern Tunisia, he went to El Golea on the
road to Tuat and thence turned towards Ghadames and Tripolitania.
He eventually reached Ghat, and returned to the Mediterranean coast
by Murzuk and Sokna, taking a more easterly road than Barth’s in
1850. Beurmann in 1862, and Dickson ten years previously, had
reached the edge of the same Tuareg country, but what Barth had
done for the Tuareg of Air and the south, Duveyrier did for the
Ahaggaren and Azger.</p>
<p>In 1881, twenty years after the expedition of Burin to Tuat, the
French determined to penetrate the countries of this fabled race. A
column under Colonel Flatters, who had already gained a certain
reputation in France as a Saharan explorer, marched almost due
south from Wargla and Tuggurt in the eastern part of Southern
Algeria up the Ighaghar basin and so reached the north-eastern
corner of the Ahaggar country. This valley is the drainage system
of the north central Sahara towards the Mediterranean; it virtually
divides the old Azger country from that of the Ahaggaren. Near the
Aghelashem Wells at the intersection of the valley with the
Ghat-Insalah road, Flatters turned S.E., intending apparently to
follow the Ghat-Air caravan road to the Sudan. This track he
proposed joining at or near the wells of Issala, and then to
proceed by much the same route as that which Barth and his
companions had selected in 1850. But at Bir Gharama in the Tin
Tarabin valley, a few days before it was due to reach Issala,
disaster overtook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> the
column. The European officers, who assumed that their penetration
of the Tuareg country was welcome to the inhabitants, had taken
none of the military precautions necessary in hostile country. The
vital part of the expedition, the officer commanding and his staff,
left camp to reconnoitre a well and became separated from their
troops, consisting of about eighty Algerian tirailleurs. The
officers were attacked by the Tuareg and killed. After the death of
Colonel Flatters and Captain Masson, the remainder of the column
under Captain Dianous made an attempt to escape north. After an
unsuccessful effort by the Tuareg to destroy the party by selling
the men dates poisoned with the Alfalehle plant (<i>Hyoscyamus
Falezlez</i>),<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> the column reached the Ighaghar once more at the
wells of Amjid. But they found the wells occupied by the enemy, and
in the ensuing fight Captain Dianous and nearly all his men were
killed.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the disaster, so vividly recounted by
Duveyrier to the Paris Geographical Society on 22nd April, 1881,
had followed the publication of his account of a people whom he had
described picturesquely, but with some exaggeration, as the
“Knights of the Desert.” The massacre created a profound impression
in France. The Tuareg came to be regarded as an insurmountable
obstacle to the French penetration of North Africa, and expeditions
into their country were discontinued. The disaster of Bir Gharama
remained unavenged until 1902, when a detachment of Camel Corps
under Lieut. Cottonest met the pick of the Ahaggar Tuareg in battle
at Tit within their own mountains and killed 93 men out of 299
present, the French patrol losing only 4 killed and 2 wounded out
of 120 native soldiers and Arab scouts. Despite the small numbers
involved, the fight at Tit broke the resistance of Ahaggar, for it
proved the vanity of matching a few old flintlocks and spears and
swords against magazine rifles.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But if it
demonstrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> the
futility of overt resistance, it also established for all time the
courage of the camel riders of the desert, who hurled themselves
against a barrier of rifle fire, unprotected by primeval forest or
sheltering jungle, in order to maintain their age-long defiance of
the mastery of foreign people.</p>
<p>Considering the magnitude of the results they achieve, Saharan,
like Arabian, battles involve surprisingly small numbers. The size
of armed bodies moving over the desert is limited by the capacity
of the wells; the output of water not only regulates the mass of
raiding bands, but also determines their strategy, as well as the
routes of trading caravans, which are compelled to move in large
bodies in order to ensure even a small measure of protection. Only
the realisation of this rather self-evident fact enabled the French
in the course of years to deal with raiders in Southern Algeria by
organising Camel Corps patrols of relatively small size and great
mobility. The privations which these raiders are willing to endure
made it impossible to fight them with a European establishment.</p>
<p>The necessity of imitating the nomad in his mode of life and
warfare became obvious to Laperrine from his first sojourn in
Southern Algeria, where he made his career as the greatest European
desert leader in history with one solitary exception. The encounter
of Tit was followed by a number of “Tournées d’Apprivoisement,”
patrols to “tame” the desert folk, initiated by Laperrine, and
culminating in 1904 in a protracted reconnaissance through Ahaggar,
which brought about a final pacification. Charles de Foucauld,
soldier, traveller and monk, had accompanied the patrol. He
remained on after it was over as a hermit and student among the
Ahaggaren until his death in 1916. He had been Laperrine’s brother
officer at St. Cyr. Extravagant, reckless and endowed with all the
good things of the world, a member of the old French aristocracy in
a smart cavalry regiment, the Marquis de Foucauld is one of the
most picturesque figures of modern times. After a memorable
reconnaissance of Morocco in 1883-4, disguised as a
Jew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> he became a
Trappist monk, and eventually entered a retreat at Beni Abbes, in
the desert that he loved too well to leave in all his life. During
his years in Ahaggar as a teacher of the Word of God he made no
converts to Christianity, but sought by his example alone to lead
the people along the way of Truth. It is to be hoped that, in spite
of a modesty which precluded it during his lifetime, the knowledge
and lore of the Tuareg which he collected in the form of notes will
eventually be given to the world in order to supplement his
dictionary of the Ahaggar dialect, to-day the standard work on
their language, which is called Temajegh.<a id=
"FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p>To implement the Laperrine policy of long reconnaissances, a
post was built near Tamanghasset in Ahaggar called Fort Motylinski,
after an officer interpreter who was one of the first practical
students of Temajegh. Lately the post has been moved to
Tamanghasset itself, where Father de Foucauld had built his
hermitage, and it is now called Fort Laperrine, in memory of the
great soldier who was killed flying across the desert to Timbuctoo
in 1919.</p>
<p>Another post was built at Janet not far from Ghat, to watch the
Azger Tuareg. Its capture during the late war by the Arabs and
Tuareg of Ghat, and the killing of Father de Foucauld by a raiding
party from the Fezzan, are incidents in that same series of
intrigues which were instigated in North Africa by the Central
Empires and carried on with such success in the Western Desert of
Egypt, Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, Southern Algeria and as far afield
as Air. If the Senussi leaders have not been responsible for as
many intrigues as it has been the fashion to ascribe to this
puritanical and perhaps fanatical sect, the Germans at least
discovered what others are still learning, that the latent force of
nationalism in North Africa among the ancient Libyan and
Arab-Libyan peoples is powerful still to-day. The spirit of the
Circumcelliones and of the opponents of Islam in the
eighth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> century was
exploited by the Turks and Germans through the Senussiya, which
provided the only organisation available during the Great War,
though in fact only few Tuareg and Arabs at Ghat or in the Fezzan
were members of, or even friendly to, the sect. These people used
the opportunity afforded by the war to procure arms and material
through the Senussiya for the consummation of their own ambitions.
The new spirit which is abroad in Islam, in Africa as well as in
Asia, is an interesting subject of study for the practical
politician. There is no occasion to enlarge upon it here.</p>
<p>In consequence of these agitations, a raid came out of the east
and fell upon Father de Foucauld’s hermitage on the 1st December,
1916. The hermit was killed, but the raiders were not of the
Ahaggaren among whom he had lived, and to whom he had devoted his
life; they came from Ghat and the Fezzan. They probably started
without intent to murder, but because Charles de Foucauld was the
greatest European influence in the desert at that time, they
desired to remove him and perhaps to hold him as a hostage. In
justice it must be admitted that no one had any illusions regarding
the political views of the people of the Fezzan; they were in a
state of open warfare with the French posts in Southern Algeria. De
Foucauld had played a very great part against them in preventing
the Ahaggaren rising <em>en masse</em> against the French; he was
an important intelligence centre for the neighbouring Fort
Motilynski; he was apparently, well provided with rifles in his
hermitage. When surprised by the raid, he disdained to fight,
preferring to fall a martyr to his religion and his country. My
excuse, if any is needed, for touching on a subject tending to be
controversial is the appearance of a number of mis-statements
concerning the barbarity of his murder and the treachery of the
people to whom Father de Foucauld had devoted the latter part of
his life. It is well to remember, in the first place, that the
circumstances of his life and his prestige made the attack a
justifiable act of war, for he played a definitely political rôle;
secondly, that there was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_14">[14]</span> no treachery or betrayal; and lastly, that
his aggressors were a mixed band of Arabs and of Tuareg from
another part of the Sahara which had, for generations past, been on
terms of raid and counter-raid with the people of Ahaggar.</p>
<p>When all has been said of the European penetration of the Tuareg
country, it is not very much. The world outside the society of
those white men who, during the last fifty years, have spent their
lives in the Sahara, can know but little of this race or of their
country. The modern literature on the subject is small, even in
French; in English it is almost non-existent. On the Tuareg of Air
there are only two works of any value: the one by a French officer
is recent in date and sadly superficial;<a id=
"FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the other is incorporated in H. Barth’s account of the British
expedition of 1849 and subsequent years to Central Africa.<a id=
"FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
There are a few other works in French about the Tuareg of the north
and south-west, but I am not aware that anyone has attempted a
general study of the whole people, who have been rather neglected
by science. The principal object of this volume will have been
achieved if it in any measure fills a want in English records or if
it arouses sufficient controversy to induce others to undertake a
thorough investigation of the race.</p>
<p>The Tuareg are not a tribe but a people. The name “Tuareg” is
not their own: it is a term of opprobrium applied to them by their
enemies, and connotes certain peculiarities possessed by a number
of tribal confederations which have no common name for themselves
as a race. The men of this people, after reaching a certain age,
wear a strip of thin cloth wound around their heads in such a
manner as to form a hood over the eyes and a covering over the
mouth and nostrils. Only a narrow slit is left open for the eyes,
and no other part of the face is visible. From this practice they
became known to the Arabs as the “Muleththemin”<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> or “Veiled People,”<a id=
"FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
while they themselves, in default of a national name, are in the
habit of using the same locution in their own tongue to describe
the whole society of different castes which compose their
community. Whatever the social position of the men, the Veil is
invariably worn by day and by night,<a id=
"FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
while the women go unveiled. Few races are more rigidly observant
of social distinction between noble and servile tribes; none holds
to a tradition of dress with more ritual conservatism.</p>

</div>
<p>The larger divisions of Tuareg have names by which they are
known to themselves and to their neighbours: these names designate
the historical or geographical groupings of tribes. In each group
of tribes the existence of nobles and serfs is recognised; there
are appropriate terms to describe these social distinctions. The
nobles are called Imajeghan;<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the servile people,
Imghad. But no name other than Kel Tagilmus,<a id=
"FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
the “People of the Veil,” exists to describe the society of nobles
and serfs alike, irrespective of group or caste. These details will
require fuller examination in due course, but it is important to
realise immediately that the name Tuareg<a id=
"FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
is unknown in their own language and is only used of them by Arabs
and other foreigners. It has, however, been so universally adopted
by everyone who has had to do with them or who has written of them
that, although not strictly accurate, it would be pedantic not to
continue using it. The Tuareg all speak the same language, called
Temajegh, which varies only dialectically from group to group. They
have a peculiar form of script, known as T’ifinagh, which also is
practically identical in all the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_16">[16]</span> divisions of the Tuareg, but is apparently
not used by other peoples. Lastly, the Tuareg are nomads by
instinct and, save where much intermarriage has taken place, of the
same racial type. The conquest of foreign elements in war and their
assimilation into servile tribes have, in the course of time, led
to some modification of physique and a growth of sedentarism in
certain areas. As a whole, however, the nation has survived in a
fairly pure state which is readily distinguishable. There is, I
think, no justification for considering the People of the Veil a
large tribal group of Berbers in North Africa; they are a separate
race with marked peculiarities, distinct from other sections of the
latter, and, as I believe, of a different origin.</p>
<p>They formerly extended further west almost to the sea-board of
the Atlantic; their northern and eastern extension can also be
deduced from what is known of their migrations. Their neighbours to
the south are the negroid Kanuri, Hausa-speaking peoples,<a id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and the Fulani; to the east are the Tebu, and in the west the Arab
and Moorish tribes; finally, in the north the nomadic and sedentary
Arabs and sedentary Libyans of Algeria, Tunisia and Tripolitania.
The N.E. corner of Tuareg territory, the Fezzan, is ethnically of
such mixed population as to admit of no summary classification;
Arab, Libyan, Tebu and negroid peoples are all inextricably mingled
together. The Tuareg wander as nomads over the country generally,
the negroes and sedentary Libyans till the ground, and, in addition
to a proportion of all those already enumerated, the towns are
inhabited by yet another people of noble origin, whose connection
with the ancient Garamantes of classical authors may be assumed if
it cannot be proved. With the exception of the Fezzan the Tuareg
are now predominant within their own country. It includes two great
groups of mountains, Air and Ahaggar, together with certain smaller
adjacent massifs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>It is
unfortunately not possible to deal with Air in history nor with the
Tuareg of Air, by considering the mountains and their inhabitants
alone. The migrations of the Tuareg of Air have been so intimately
connected with that part of the Sudan which we now call Nigeria
that the northern fringe of the area and the country intervening
between it and Air must receive attention. This intervening steppe
and desert, largely overrun by Tuareg, lie on the way which I
followed to reach the mountains. The neglect to which these areas
have been subjected justifies me in devoting a chapter to them
before coming to Air itself. Again, the concluding chapters of this
volume will deal as much with the Southland as they do with Air,
for the history of the latter cannot be divorced from that of the
former.</p>
<p>Since mention will be continually made of the various Tuareg
groups as they exist to-day, and of the tribes which they contain,
it will be as well to explain that there are to-day four principal
divisions of the people, all of whom possess characteristics common
and peculiar to the whole race.</p>
<p>The main groups are:—</p>
<table class="tab-p" id="t017">
<tr>
<td class="tdr-top tab-p">1.</td>
<td class="tdl-top hang1">The People of Ahaggar, called Ahaggaren,
or Kel Ahaggar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr-top tab-p">2.</td>
<td class="tdl-top hang1">The Azjer, or Azger Tuareg; this name is
also spelt Askar, Adjeur, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr-top tab-p">3.</td>
<td class="tdl-top hang1">The People of Air called the Kel Air, or,
in the Hausa language which is current in that country, Asbenawa or
Absenawa, from Asben, Azbin or Absen, the Sudanese name for
Air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr-top tab-p">4.</td>
<td class="tdl-top hang1">The Tuareg of the south-west.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The first group is held for convenience to include the Tuareg in
the Ahnet mountains, the Taitoq, and those north-west of the
Ahaggar mountains. The second group is comparatively compact. The
third group is the one with which this volume deals in detail, and
includes the Kel Geres and other Tuareg generally of the Southland,
in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> on the fringes
of Nigeria. The fourth group should more properly be divided, as it
comprises the distinct aggregations of the Aulimmiden, the Ifoghas
of the Mountain (Ifoghas n’Adghar),<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the Tuareg of
Timbuctoo and the Niger.</p>
<p>The country of the Ahaggaren proper is confined to the Ahaggar
massif, but there are certain outlying districts to the north and
north-west. The confused mass of hills east of Ahaggar towards the
Fezzan was, at the beginning of the century, essentially the
country of the Azger. In recent years they have tended to move
eastwards towards their original homes and away from the influence
of the French military posts. The majority of this group now ranges
over the country between Ghat and Murzuk. They are the Tuareg who
have come least into contact with Europeans. Although there is
considerable affinity between them and the Ahaggaren, the Tuareg
generally recognise that the Azger do not belong to, or are under
the rule of, the Ahaggar chieftains despite the fact that they are
all collectively known in Air as Ahaggaren. Those travellers who
have known them are at one in considering them to-day an
independent division. From the historical point of view the Azger
are the most important of all the Tuareg, since from this group,
reduced in numbers as it now is, most of the migrations of the race
to the Southlands seem to have taken place. They are also probably
to-day the purest of the Tuareg stock in existence.</p>
<p>The first description of Air and its people in any detail was
brought back to Europe by Barth after his memorable journey from
the Mediterranean to the Sudan, on which he set out in 1849 with
Richardson and Overweg, but from which he alone returned alive more
than five years later. Prior to this journey there are certain
references in Ibn Batutah and Leo Africanus, but they do not give
us much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> information
either of the country or of the people. From Ibn Batutah’s
description, the country he traversed is recognisable, but the
information is meagre. The account of Leo Africanus written in the
sixteenth century is little better. His principal contribution, in
the English and original Italian versions, is a bad pun: “Likewise
Hair (Air), albeit a desert, yet so called for the goodness and
temperature of the aire. . . .”<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is an observation, in
fact, of great truth, but hardly more useful than his other
statement, which records that the “soyle aboundeth with all kinds
of herbes,” in apparent contradiction with the previous remark. He
adds that “a great store of manna” is found not far from Agades
which the people “gather in certaine little vessels, carrying it,
when it is new, into the market of the town to be mingled with
water as a refreshing drink”—an allusion probably to the “pura” or
“ghussub” water made of millet meal, water and milk or cheese. He
states that the country is inhabited by the “Targa” people, and as
he mentions Agades, it had evidently by then been founded, but
beyond these facts his description is wholly inadequate. He
unfortunately even forgets to mention that Air is mountainous.</p>
<p>Although the European penetration of the Western Sahara may date
from the Middle Ages, the same cannot be said of Air. Caillé in
1828 was, in fact, not the first European to visit and describe
Timbuctoo, nor was Rohlfs in 1864 the first European in Tuat. There
are some very interesting earlier accounts which are gradually
being unearthed<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> dealing with these countries. It is
regrettable that there are apparently no similar accounts of
Air.<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> The first information of any value is found
only in comparatively recent times. Hornemann<a id=
"FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
in 1798 travelled from Egypt along<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> the Haj Road which runs from Timbuctoo to
Cairo. He turned back at Murzuk, but had he continued he would have
come to Ghat and eventually to Air. He nevertheless brought back
the first modern account of the Tuareg of this country, or rather
of a section of them, the Kel Owi, whom he calls the Kolouvey. His
information about the Ahaggaren and about the divisions of the
Tebu, who lived east and north-east beyond the limits of the
country which they now occupy, is worth examining in connection
with their ethnological history. After Hornemann’s journey Denham,
Oudney and Clapperton<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> collected some further details about Air
and its people in the course of an expedition to Chad and Nigeria
at the beginning of the last century, and in 1845 Richardson began
a systematic study of the Azger and Air Tuareg during a preliminary
journey to the Fezzan. But none of these travellers had the
first-hand personal experience which, five years afterwards, Barth,
Richardson and Overweg obtained on their expedition.</p>
<p>The part played by Great Britain in the exploration of the
Central Sahara, testified to by the graves of many Englishmen or
foreigners in the service of the British Crown, is little known in
this country. Our efforts to abolish the slave trade in Africa and
our paramount position in Tripolitania early in the last century
led to that initiative being taken, to which the world even to-day
owes most of its knowledge of the Fezzan, and which opened the
Sudan to commerce and colonisation. While Richardson was apparently
the first and only Englishman to visit Air until my travelling
companion, Angus Buchanan, went there from Nigeria in 1919, the
graves of explorers in neighbouring lands show that we stand second
to none in geographical work in the Central Sahara. It was only
when, in the partition of North Africa, this vast area fell to the
French, that there was any falling off in the numbers of Englishmen
who in each successive decade travelled and died there. Their work
deserves to be better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
known: Henry Warrington died of dysentery at the desert well of
Dibbela, south of Bilma in Kawar, on his way to Lake Chad with a
German, Dr. Vogel. Dr. Oudney died on 5th January, 1824, at Murmur
near Hadeija (Northern Nigeria), after accompanying Clapperton and
Denham from Tripoli by way of Bilma and Chad to explore Bornu.
Tyrwhit, who went out to join them, died at Kuka on Lake Chad, on
22nd October, 1824. Barth’s companion Richardson died in the early
part of 1851 at N’Gurutawa in Manga, S. of Zinder, and their
companion Overweg succumbed near Lake Chad. Both Barth and Overweg
were Germans who had volunteered and were appointed to serve on an
expedition sent by Her Majesty’s Government to explore Central
Africa and to report on the abolition of the slave trade. Dr.
Vogel, another German, who had been sent by Her Majesty’s
Government to join Barth and complete his work, died near Lake Chad
after his return, while an assistant, Corporal MacGuire, was killed
on his way home at Beduaram, N. of Bilma, in the same year. Of
those who had opened the way for the Clapperton expeditions,
Ritchie had died of disease in 1819 at Murzuk and Lyon had been
obliged to turn back before reaching Bornu. Clapperton himself on a
second journey lost his life at Sokoto on 13th April, 1827. North
Africa has claimed her British victims no less than the swamps and
jungles of Equatoria, only they are not so well known, for they
never sought to advertise their achievements.</p>
<p>Few people in this country or abroad realise how great was the
influence of Great Britain in the Sahara during the lifetime and
after the death of that remarkable man, Colonel Hamer Warrington,
H.M. Consul at Tripoli from 1814 to 1846. Apart from the fact that
he virtually governed Tripoli, our influence and interests may be
gauged by the existence of Vice-Consulates and Consulates, not only
along the coast at Khoms and Misurata, but far in the interior at
Ghadames and Murzuk. The peregrinations of numerous travellers and
efforts to suppress the African slave trade had<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> obliged Her Majesty’s Government
to play a part in local tribal politics, for it had early become
clear that if this abominable traffic was to be abolished the
sources of supply would have to be controlled, since it proved
useless only to make representations on the coast where caravans
discharged their human cargo. At one moment it even seemed as if
Tripolitania would be added to the British Empire, and as lately as
1870 travellers were still talking of the French and British
factions among the Fezzanian tribes. But Free Trade and other
political controversies in England half-way through the century
brought about a pause, and the arrest was enough to withdraw public
interest from North Africa and to give France her chance. The
controversies were the object of much bitter criticism by the
idealist Richardson, who saw political dialectics obscuring a
crusade on behalf of humanity for which he was destined to give his
life. He seems to have been profoundly affected and to have
suffered himself to become warped, as Barth on more than one
occasion discovered.<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The inevitable consequence of a British
occupation of Tripolitania would have been the active penetration
of the Air and Chad roads and a junction with the explorers and
merchants who were working north from the Bight of Benin. But
French interest in North Africa as a consequence of their
occupation of Algeria grew progressively stronger as it declined in
this country, while to the same waning appetite must be ascribed
the fact that for seventy years no Englishman visited Air.
Regrettable as this may appear to geographers, it is even more
tragic to realise how few have heard of the German, Dr. Heinrich
Barth, than whom it may be said there never has been a more
courageous or meticulously accurate explorer. After several notable
journeys further north he accompanied Richardson as a volunteer,
and on the latter’s death continued the exploration of Africa for
another four years on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, which he
most loyally served.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
If in this volume he is repeatedly mentioned, it is without
misgiving or apology; it may help in some little measure to rescue
his name from unmerited oblivion in these days of sensational and
superficial books of travel. The account of his journey and of the
lore and history of the countries of Central Africa which he
visited from Timbuctoo to Lake Chad is still a standard work.</p>
<p>Barth and his companions entered Air in August 1850, and left
the country for the south in the closing days of the same year.
Reaching Asiu from Ghat, they traversed the northern mountains of
Air, which are known to the Tuareg as Fadé.<a id=
"FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
After passing by the wells in the T’iyut valley and the “agilman”
(pool) of Taghazit, they camped eight days later on the northern
outskirts of Air proper. During this period their caravan was
subjected to constant threats of brigandage from parties of
northern Tuareg, and on the day before reaching the first permanent
habitations of Air in the Ighazar near Seliufet village, they again
narrowly escaped aggression from the local inhabitants. An attack
was eventually made on them at T’intaghoda, a little further on,
and they only just escaped with their lives after losing a good
deal of property. The same experience was repeated near
T’intellust, where the expedition had established its head-quarters
in the great valley which drains the N.E. side of the Air
mountains. When, however, they had once made friends with that
remarkable personality, Annur, chief of the Kel Owi tribal
confederation, and paramount chief of Air, they were free from
further molestation, and thanks to him eventually they reached the
Sudan in safety. From T’intellust Barth made a journey alone to
Agades by a road running west of the central Bagezan mountains.
After his return the whole party moved to the Southland along the
great Tripoli-Sudan trade route which passes east of the Central
massifs. Crossing the southern part of Air known as Tegama they
entered Damergu, which geographically belongs to the Sudan, about
New Year’s Day, 1851. In the course of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_24">[24]</span> his stay in Air Barth made the first sketch
map of the country, catalogued the principal tribes and compiled a
summary of their history which is still the most valuable
contribution which we possess on the subject.</p>
<p>Some twenty-seven years later, another German, Erwin von Bary,
reached Air from the north by much the same road as that which
Barth and his companions had followed. He left Ghat in January 1897
and reached the villages of Northern Air a month later. Thence he
journeyed to the village of Ajiru, a village on the eastern slopes
of the central mountains, and awaited the return from a raid of
Belkho, the chieftain who had succeeded Barth’s friend Annur as
paramount lord of the country. The unfortunate von Bary was
subjected to every form of extortion, and though Belkho, when he
returned, compelled his people to restore what they had stolen, the
chief himself made life unpleasant for the traveller by taking all
his presents and doing nothing for him in return so long as he
showed any desire to proceed on his journey southwards. Belkho
pleaded such poverty that the explorer nearly died of starvation,
but von Bary admittedly had laid himself open to every form of
abuse. He had arrived almost penniless, did not understand the
courtesies of desert travelling, and seems to have placed undue
reliance on his skill as a doctor to achieve his objects. But when
he eventually gave up the idea of going on to the Sudan, Belkho
treated him well. Although von Bary’s opinion of the Tuareg of Air
is not favourable, in reality he owed them a great debt of
gratitude. No other people who dislike foreigners so much as they
do would have protected him and helped him as they finally did. His
quarrels with Belkho seem to have been in part due to his own
tactlessness and discourtesy, and in part to his inability to
realise that the chief, for political reasons, did not desire him
to go to the Sudan. Von Bary returned to Ghat, meaning to try once
more to reach Nigeria as soon as he had picked up his stores and
some more money, but his diary ends abruptly with the remark that
he would be ready to start south again<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> from there in fifteen to twenty days. He died
within twenty-four hours of reaching Ghat, on 3rd October, 1877. He
had spent a cheerful evening with Kaimakam,<a id=
"FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and had gone to bed; at 6 a.m. he was breathing peacefully asleep;
by ten o’clock he was dead. His death does not seem to have been
quite natural. It remains one of the mysteries of the Sahara. Von
Bary’s account of Air<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> is very incomplete and his observations
are coloured by the hardships which he suffered. With the exception
of certain botanical information and notes on one or two
ethnological points, his descriptions contain little that had not
already been made known by Barth.</p>
<p>Then began that competition among European Powers for African
colonies which was soon to reach a critical stage. The Anglo-German
Convention of 1890 had proposed to divide Africa finally, but
before that date the French had seen one desirable part after the
other fall to our lot. They determined before it was too late to
take as much as possible of what still remained unallocated.
Central Africa, east of Lake Chad, certain tracts of indifferent
country on the western coast and the greater part of the Sahara
were still unclaimed by any European Power. And so it was that in
France the magnificent scheme was conceived of sending three
columns from north, west and south to converge on Lake Chad, and
formally to take possession of the lands through which they passed
in accordance with the stipulations of the Congress of Berlin,
where it had been laid down that territorial claims were only valid
if substantiated by effective occupation. It was not till 1899,
however, that the French plans reached maturity. Three expeditions
duly set out from the Congo, the Western Sudan and Algeria to cross
Africa and meet on Lake Chad. Their adventures constitute one of
the most romantic chapters in Colonial history. The western column,
at first under Captain Voulet,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_26">[26]</span> who was accompanied by Lieut. Chanoine and
others, marched from the Niger along the northern edge of the
Nigerian Emirates. Mutiny and murder among the European personnel
were experienced. French politics at home, where the Jewish
question had become acute, were responsible for all manner of
delays; the command changed hands repeatedly. But the northern
column and the Congo party were equally delayed; not until a year
after the date fixed for the rendezvous on the lake did the three
expeditions meet. The military escorts were united under Commandant
Lamy, and gave battle to the forces of Rabah, one of the Khalif’s
generals, who had crossed half Africa to carve out for himself a
kingdom in Bornu and Bagirmi after the <em>débâcle</em> of the
Mahdia on the Upper Nile. Lamy defeated him and annexed French
Equatorial Africa.</p>
<p>Of these three expeditions, the northern column, known as the
Foureau-Lamy Mission, had passed through Air on its way south. The
Europeans who accompanied it were in 1899 the first Frenchmen to
enter the country and to carry out the plan originally contemplated
by Flatters in 1881. The annexation of Air by France may be counted
from this date.</p>
<p>The Foureau-Lamy Mission<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> entered the borders of Air
from Algeria at the wells of In Azawa; their heavy losses in camels
obliged them to abandon large quantities of material, but they
eventually reached Iferuan in the Ighazar, not far from
T’intaghoda. Here the camp of the expedition was attacked in force
by the Tuareg, who were only driven off with great difficulty. The
situation was critical. The whole country was hostile to the
French; they were so short of camels that on the stage south of
Iferuan to Agellal they had to move their baggage in small lots,
marching their transport forwards and backwards. Their destiny hung
in the balance when friendly overtures were made to them near
Auderas by a Tuareg of considerable note, Ahodu of the Kel Tadek
tribe, whose fathers and forefathers for five generations
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> been keepers of
the mosque of Tefgun near Iferuan. Ahodu’s political sense has
rarely been at fault, either then or since; he saw that the only
end possible for his people from protracted hostilities with the
Europeans was disaster. He promised the French peace while the
column remained in Air. It reached Agades in safety, and the Sultan
was obliged to hoist the French flag and provide transport animals
and guides. No attack was made near the town, thanks to the
efficacy of Ahodu’s presence, but his powers of persuasion were
insufficient when the column marched out into the barren area
further south. The guide purposely misled the expedition and it
nearly perished of thirst, succeeding only with great difficulty in
returning to Agades. It eventually started once more and reached
the south, where its story ceases to concern the exploration of
Air.</p>
<p>Since 1899, then, the fate of Air has been settled in so far as
Europe was concerned, for it was recognised as lying within the
French sphere; but the country was not effectually occupied until
1904, when a camel patrol under Lieut. C. Jean established a post
at Agades. The post was evacuated for a short time and then
reoccupied. The exploration of the mountains has proceeded slowly
since that date. Sketch maps were gradually compiled in the course
of camel corps patrols, and in 1910 the Cortier geographical
mission published a very creditable map of the mountains,<a id=
"FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
other than the northern Fadé group, based on thirty-three
astronomically determined co-ordinates supplementing the five
secured by the Foureau-Lamy Mission. Chudeau in 1905 made a brief
geological survey and published some notes on the flora, which
remain uncatalogued to this day;<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> very complete collections
of the fauna have been made by Buchanan<a id=
"FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and examined in England by the British Museum (South Kensington)
and by Lord Rothschild’s museum at<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_28">[28]</span> Tring. The ethnology of the country is very
superficially discussed in a book published by Jean; Barth’s
account remains the one of value. The complete exploration of the
mountains and detailed mapping still remain to be done as well as
other scientific work of every description.</p>
<p>“Air” as a geographical term for the mountainous plateau does
not signify exactly the same thing to the inhabitants of the
country themselves as it does to us; properly speaking, it is
applied by them only to one part of the plateau, for the whole of
which the more usual name of Asben or Absen is used. The latter is
probably the original name given to the area by the people of the
Sudan before the advent of the Tuareg. It is now very generally
used even by them: it is universal further south. Barth has
speculated at some length upon the origin of the name Air or Ahir,
to take its Arabic form, and concluded that the letter “h” had been
deliberately added out of modesty to guard against the word
acquiring a copronymous signification. But early Arabic geographers
give the form as Akir and not as Ahir, so the laborious explanation
of the learned traveller is probably unnecessary.</p>
<p>The boundaries of Air may be defined either as running along the
line where the rocks of the area dip below the sands of the desert,
or as following certain well-marked basins and watercourses of
material size, where disintegrated rock or alluvium has covered the
lower slopes of the hills. The mountainous area is some 300 miles
long by 200 miles broad. It lies wholly within the tropics and is
surrounded by desert or by arid steppe. Owing to the general
elevation of the country the climate is quite pleasant.</p>

</div>
<p>In remote ages the rainfall of the Central Sahara was sufficient
to create the deep and important river beds which compose the
hydrographic system of this part of North Africa. Among these
watercourses is one of great size, flowing from the Ahaggar massif
towards Algeria, called the Ighaghar. Duveyrier has tried to prove
that it was the Niger of Pliny, largely on the grounds that the
root “Ig”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> or “Igh”
occurs in both words and in Temajegh means “to run.” The effect of
this identification, which is hard to accept, would be to make the
classical ethnology of the Sahara less easy to follow, but it has
little significance in considering Air, except in so far as it
would tend to show that the geographical knowledge of the Romans
did not extend as far south as the plateau. Complementary to the
Ighaghar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> but flowing
south from the Ahaggar massif is another equally great river,<a id=
"FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which early in its course is joined by a large tributary from the
Western Fezzan. At a certain point this valley is crossed by the
roads from Air to Ahaggar and Ghat, branching respectively at the
wells of In Azawa or Asiu. The eastern branch is the caravan road
to Ghat from the Sudan, the western one finds its way to In Salah
in Tuat and to Algeria. This bed runs south and south-west towards
the Niger, which it must have reached at some point between Gao and
Timbuctoo in the neighbourhood of the N.E. corner of the Great Bend
which the French call “La Boucle du Niger.” This river of remote
times must have been one of the great watercourses of Africa,
extending from the head-waters in 26° N. Lat. to its mouth in the
Bight of Benin on the Equator. It is not possible to say whether
the interesting terrestrial changes which diverted the Upper Niger
at the lagoons above Timbuctoo into the present Lower Niger, and
which brought about the desiccation of the upper reaches, took
place suddenly or gradually, but the latter is more probable, for a
similar diversion seems to be going on in the Chad area. The lake,
in reality an immense marsh and lagoon, is much smaller than when
it perhaps included the depression noted by Tilho as extending most
of the way to Tibesti; some of the waters of the Chad feeders are
already believed to be finding their way in flood-time into the
Benue, and it is possible that in the course of time a similar
process to that manifested in the Niger area will take place; then
Lake Chad will dry up into salt-pans like those at Taodenit. The
Saharan river, which flows southward to the west of Air, bears
various names. Its course has never been accurately determined, but
its general direction is known. From Ahaggar to a point level with
the northernmost parts of Air it is called Tafassasset. The T’in
Tarabin channel from Ahaggar more probably drained into the Belly
of the Desert than into this system, but the Alfalehle
(Wadi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> Falezlez) from
the Western Fezzan most certainly seems to be a tributary; there
are various reasons why it ought not to flow towards Kawar, as used
at one time to be thought. West of Air the main bed spreads out
into a vast plain-like basin under the name of T’immersoi; further
south it is called Azawak. In general I prefer to use the name
T’immersoi for the whole until a better one is suggested.<a id=
"FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p>The T’immersoi forms a collector in the west of Air for nearly
all the water from this group of mountains. Nowadays only a
comparatively small amount ever reaches the basin, as much is
absorbed by the intervening plain land of Talak<a id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and the Assawas swamp west of Agades. The latter are local basins
or sumps covered with dense vegetation where some of the most
nomadic tribes in Air pasture their herds. Talak is visited by
Tuareg from Ahaggar and from the west for the same purpose. It
plays an important part in the economy of the country, for water is
always to be found in the alluvial soil however dry the season in
the mountains has been. Many of the wells have now fallen into
disuse, but the output of those which remain is still plentiful.
The last rocks of Air on the west disappear below the alluvium of
T’immersoi and in the subsidiary basins of Talak and Assawas. The
T’immersoi system therefore forms the western boundary of Air.</p>
<p>The upper part of the T’immersoi, where it is called the
Tafassasset, is also the northern boundary of Air. The wells of In
Azawa<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a> and Asiu in this valley may be regarded as the
point where the main roads from the north enter the extreme limits
of the country. Further east on another road between Air and Ghat,
von Bary fixed the boundary at the Wadi Immidir, which is in the
same latitude as In Azawa.<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>The eastern
boundary of Air runs along the line where the last rocks of the
group disappear below the sand of the steppe and desert, which
extends from north to south between the mountains of the Fezzan and
the fringe of Equatorial Africa, and from west to east between the
mountains of Air and those of Tibesti with its adjacent massifs.
This vast area is crossed by a few roads only, the most important
ones being (<em>a</em>) the road from Murzuk along the Kawar
depression to Agadem and Lake Chad, (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>),
the two principal tracks from Air eastwards to Bilma by Ashegur and
Fashi respectively, and (<em>d</em>) the road from Zinder by Termit
to Fashi and Kawar. Watering-points are very few, and the habitable
oases can be numbered on the fingers of two hands; pasturage is
everywhere scarce. This great waste is one of the most unknown
parts of North Africa; its eastern portion along the Tibesti
mountains as far north as the Fezzan may be said to be absolutely
unknown except for two tracks to the mountains whither occasional
camel patrols have passed.</p>
<p>Kawar and the other oases along the Chad road appear to be
closed basins of the Eastern Saharan type. They seem to have no
outlet towards the south either into the Chad or into the Niger
systems. The desert east of Air, therefore, contains the eastern
watershed of the T’immersoi basin, for the valleys of Eastern Air
do not run into the desert as Chudeau has suggested,<a id=
"FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
but turn southwards on leaving the hills, in ill-defined
depressions or folds which join the Tagedufat valley or one of the
other channels flowing westwards in Tegama or Damergu. One valley
to the south of Air, probably the Tagedufat itself, is stated to
run all the way from Fashi across the desert.</p>
<p>The southern limits of Air may be placed along the Tagedufat
basin, where the rocks of Air disappear below the sand dunes and
downs of Tegama and Azawagh steppe<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_33">[33]</span> desert. The valley is of some size and flows
roughly N.E. and S.W. towards T’immersoi, but whether it actually
joins this system or the Gulbi n’Kaba, which finds its way into
Sokoto Emirate under the name of the Gulbi n’Maradi and thence into
the Niger, is not certain. The former hypothesis seems more
probable, but I was unable to follow the Tagedufat sufficiently far
west to verify it, nor could I discover any data on the French
maps;<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a> local reports substantiate my supposition. Both
systems in any case are in the Niger basin. Air is not on the
watershed between Niger and Chad. The choice of the Tagedufat
valley as the southern boundary of Air is made on geographical
grounds. What may be termed the political boundary is rather
further north along the line of the River of Agades.</p>

<p>Commencing within 50 km. of the In Azawa wells, Air is a low
plateau of Silurian formation with islands of Archean rock. Through
the plateau-plain a number of separate formations have been
extruded by, in many cases, apparently quite recent volcanic
action. The northernmost massifs of Taghazit and Zelim lie in about
latitude 20°. The volcanic period was of considerable duration, but
all the recognisable volcanoes and derived phenomena are
post-Eocene.<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class=
"fnanchor">[39]</a> Some of the basalt flows, more especially those
from Mount Dogam near Auderas in Central Air, are not old, while
the Teginjir lava flow appeared to me so fresh as probably to have
come into existence during the historical period. The volcanic
phenomena take the form of cinder cones with steep sides as at
Teginjir (Mount Gheshwa), cumulo-volcanoes, as in the T’imia and
probably Bagezan massifs, domes as in the case of Mount Dogam, and
basalt flows in various parts, notably in the T’imia valleys.<a id=
"FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Aggata<a id="FNanchor_40b"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a> appears to be another volcanic peak, but the
serrated crest of Ighzan is a phenomenon of the rapid cooling of an
igneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> extrusion
rather than an example of erosion. There are numerous volcanic
massifs distinct from each other all over Air, more especially in
the centre and north; they are nearly all granitic and very rugged.
The Auderas basin is of basalt and cinerite.<a id=
"FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
The plateau, which is in the main horizontal, rises in the centre
to a step some few hundred feet higher than the north and south and
forms a pedestal for the Bagezan and other massifs some 1500 to
3000 feet higher again. The peaks are as much as 4500 feet<a id=
"FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
above the plateau, which varies from 1500 feet above sea level in
the south along the River of Agades, to 2000 feet in the Ighazar in
North Air. Round Auderas the plateau may be taken as about 2500
feet above the sea, while to the east of the Bagezan massif the
plateau is about 3000 feet, sloping gradually away to the south and
east. Between Agades and Auderas there is an abrupt ascent on to
the central step of the plateau of some 2000 feet; a corresponding
descent of about 150 feet takes place near Assada.</p>
<p>The effect of these massifs rising sharply out of the plateau is
curious. The Archean or Silurian plain and the volcanic mountain
groups are phenomena which have not yet had time to become
correlated. The result is that the broad and very gentle valleys of
the plateau-plain wander in and out among the disconnected massifs
and are fed by deep torrents draining the slopes of impermeable
rock. Water erosion has not yet had time to widen or deepen the
ravines, while the broad valleys have wide sandy bottoms, where
pebbles only rarely occur; their sides are well wooded with pasture
on the plains between the beds, except where masses of round basalt
boulders, the product of the volcanic disturbances, cover the
surface. The massifs have hardly been affected by erosion. The
broad valleys between them are the corridors of communication in
the country. “Cette superimposition à une vieille pénéplaine usée,”
says Chudeau,<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a> “de massifs éruptifs jeunes, donne a l’Air un
aspect surprenant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
presque paradoxal.” And this is the charm of the country that has
been called by travellers the Saharan Alps. There is contrast
everywhere, but nothing is perhaps more striking than the black
patina which the red rocks have assumed. The wind-borne sand has
polished them till they shine with a dark metallic gleam, while the
sheltered rifts and ravines retain their pink and red surfaces. It
is a land of lurid colour, except at midday, when the African sun
dominates everything in one blinding glare.</p>

<p class="sch">THE SOUTHLANDS</p>
<p><span class="sc">Until</span> about twenty years ago it was
easier to reach the Western Sudan and Central Africa around Lake
Chad from the north than from the Gulf of Guinea, notwithstanding a
journey of many months across the Sahara, involving all the
considerable hardships and dangers of desert travelling. The
objectives which Barth, Foureau, Lamy and their predecessors all
had in view were not the exploration of the Sahara, but the
penetration of the Sudan. By following the trade routes along which
slave caravans used to reach the Mediterranean coast, the explorers
of the nineteenth century reached the wealthy Niger lands more
easily than they would have done had they attempted to pass through
the tropical forests of the West Coast. On the sea-board European
penetration at that time was confined to the neighbourhood of a few
factories on the shore or the estuaries of certain rivers. Only at
the end of the nineteenth century did this country, first among the
nations of Europe, realise that the potential markets and supplies
of raw material which the Sudan afforded were on a scale far
surpassing those which had been dreamt of by the early pioneers on
the coast. It was about thirty years ago that communication was
eventually opened up between the coast and the Moslem interior, but
there is no doubt that the accounts of the Sudan in 1850 brought
back by Barth after his memorable journey were directly responsible
for the British penetration from the coast of those countries which
are now called Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast and Nigeria. The
movement reached its culmination in the opening years of the
twentieth century, when the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_37">[37]</span> northern provinces of Nigeria were occupied
under the guidance of Sir F. Lugard, while at about the same time
the three French columns had met near Lake Chad. With these years
the expansionist period closed and a phase of development, which
still continues, commenced. British expansion into Northern
Nigeria, coming as it did during the South African war, passed
comparatively unnoticed in this country except in official circles,
where the campaigns of Sir F. Lugard’s small columns aroused
considerable anxiety. But because the policy was successful the
public heard little of the operations which formally annexed the
outlying Emirates of Kano, Katsina and Sokoto. The new countries
which we then acquired were of colossal wealth, and contained a
population of many millions of people living as thickly in certain
parts as the Egyptians in the Nile Delta. The closing years of last
and the first few years of this century involved the addition to
the British Empire of some of the greatest of the Sudanese cities,
which are the terminal points and therefore the <em>raisons
d’être</em> of the two central Saharan trade roads which come from
the Mediterranean by way of Kawar and Air.</p>

<p>The Sudan, though geographically in Central Africa, belongs to
the Mediterranean civilisation. The great empires of the Niger,
Melle and Songhai, the Fulani Empire of Sokoto, the Emirates of
Kano and Katsina, and the Empire of Bornu, were all products of
contact with the north. Commercially and culturally, the Sudan
faced north with its back against an impenetrable belt of tropical
forest inhabited by savage negro tribes, through whose dripping and
steaming jungles there was little or no access to the sea. This
orientation explains the high degree of civilisation which Barth
found already past its “floruit” in 1850. It is obviously also the
reason why the early explorers came from the north rather than from
the nearer coast of the Atlantic between Sierra Leone and the
mouths of the Niger.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the Europeans, ways down to the coast were
gradually opened up, until finally in Nigeria<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[38]</span> seven hundred miles of railway were built
from Lagos to Kano. As a consequence trade has left the
trans-Saharan roads where the Tuareg were masters. It is now
carried to Europe and even to the Mediterranean by steamers sailing
from Lagos and Liverpool. In more ways than one the advent of the
white man in Central Africa has been disastrous for the Tuareg.
Camel-borne trade on a large scale is doomed; caravan broking and
long-distance desert transport are gone, never to return; even a
trans-Saharan railway, whose commercial value must be as unreal as
the dream of its advocates among French Colonial authorities, can
never hope to compete with sea-borne traffic. Aircraft alone may
one day revive the old camel roads, for they provide lines of
watering-points along the shortest north and south routes.</p>
<p>If one may judge by the numbers and size of the market cities,
which are the termini of the trans-Saharan routes in the Sudan, the
Air road was by far the most important of the two in the centre. In
Kano and in Katsina and in Sokoto the commercial genius of the
Hausa people developed centres for the exchange of the European
goods with the products, and more especially the raw materials, of
Central Africa. To these cities also came the negro people of the
south, to buy and sell or be sold as slaves. In a thickly populated
and extremely fertile country the cities grew to immense size.
Though in no sense properly a Tuareg country, Northern Nigeria and
the neighbouring lands are visited and lived in by the People of
the Veil. Every year it is the habit of many of this people to come
from Air to Nigeria during the dry season. They earn a prosperous
livelihood on transport work between the cities of Hausaland. They
feed their camels on the richer pastures of the south when those in
the north grow dry. But before the rains begin they move north
again to the steppe and desert, for flooded rivers and excessive
damp are conditions which the camels of the Veiled People do not
relish. Quite large colonies of Tuareg have settled in some of
these cities and have adopted a semi-sedentary life, maintaining
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> characteristics
in inverse measure as intermarriage with the negroid peoples has
become more frequent. The influx of Tuareg into Nigeria after the
1917 revolution in Air added considerably to the numbers living
permanently under British rule. This migration was not as strange a
phenomenon or so entirely the product of the Great War as at first
sight it appears to be. The various waves of Tuareg which in
succession entered Air have each in turn had the effect of driving
the earlier populations further south. The trend of migration in
North Africa from the earliest days, when the zone of permanent
habitation of the negroid races extended as far as the
Mediterranean, has always been southward. It has continued in
modern times. The temptation of richer lands in Central Africa has
always proved irresistible when local political or economic
conditions altered in consequence of growing ethnic pressure to the
extent of providing just that impetus necessary to overcome the
human disinclination to leave homes which have been occupied for
generations. The Kel Geres Tuareg left Air to settle in the country
north of Sokoto when the mountains became over-populated; masses of
Air Tuareg generally took up their habitation in Katsina and Kano
after the unsuccessful revolution against the French during the
late war. The motives were not strictly similar, but the effects
were identical, and have been observable throughout the ages.</p>

<p>To-day at Kano, a village of some size named Faji, almost
entirely Tuareg in population, has sprung up a few hundred yards
from the walls of the city. Here the People of the Veil live like
the Hausa in mud houses. They are engaged in retail trade or act as
agents and brokers for their relations in Air when the latter come
down in the dry season. In Katsina a quarter of the town and the
country immediately north are thickly populated with Tuareg, for
whom the Emir has a marked partiality, largely on account of his
commercial propensities, which are powerfully stimulated by the
ownership of several fine herds of camels. The Tuareg of Katsina,
drawn from almost every tribe in Air,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_40">[40]</span> have formed a new tribal unit known as the
Kel Katchena,<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a> and are rapidly forgetting their older tribal
allegiances. The results of these movements have always been much
the same. Progressive mixing with the negroid people of the Sudan,
the gradual acquisition of sedentary habits, and the cultivation of
fat lands where life is easy, are combining to make these People of
the Veil lose their characteristics as a northern race; their
language cannot compete with Hausa, which is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_41">[41]</span> the <em>lingua franca</em> of the Sudan,
as Arabic is that of North Africa. The retention of the Veil is the
only exception: in fact many southerners associated with them have
adopted it, although the rigorous proscription against revealing
the mouth and face is being less strictly observed.</p>
<p>North of the country surrounding the great walled cities of red
earth, and more or less coterminous with the northern frontiers of
the Emirates of Katsina, Daura, Kano and Hadeija, there is a deep
belt of country which marks the beginning of the transition between
the Saharan and the Equatorial zones.<a id=
"FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
North of the open country around Kano, with its large trees that
for a height of some feet from the ground, like those in English
parks, have been stripped of leaves by the grazing flocks and
herds, the rock outcrops become less frequent and eventually
disappear entirely. They give place to scrub, bush and clearings
through which the Anglo-French boundary runs. The frontier from
Lake Chad to the Niger was delimited in 1907 and 1908 by an
international expedition whose work has been described by Colonel
Tilho with a wealth of detail which makes one regret that his
labours did not extend a little further north, as far as the edge
of the desert where the Saharan zone proper commences. The area
mapped by Colonel Tilho hardly extends beyond the northern limit of
the Hausa-speaking people. Along the roads leading to Air, or in
other words along the great trade route, no work was done beyond
the southern fringe of the area called Damergu, and there is
consequently to the south of Air a considerable depth of unsurveyed
country for which no maps are available.</p>
<p>The area between the international boundary and the somewhat
arbitrary limits of Algeria and Tripolitania constitutes the French
colony known as the “Territoires du Niger,”<a id=
"FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
the southern part of which is divided into provinces or “cercles,”
roughly corresponding to the old native<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42">[42]</span> Emirates. French colonial policy in this part
of Africa, in contrast with the system so successfully instituted
by Sir F. Lugard in Nigeria, has been directed towards the removal
of the more important native rulers. They have been replaced by a
form of direct administration which is only now in process of being
organised under French civilian officials. North of Katsina the
Emirates of Maradi and Tessawa<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> have been combined into
one province, and here almost the last Sultan of the “Territoires”
survives, exercising authority only in the immediate vicinity of
Tessawa itself. West of this is the province of Tahua; to the east
is the old Emirate of Damagarim with its capital at Zinder, and
east again is Gure, the northern part of which is known as Elakkos
and Kuttus.</p>
<p>Once the belt of thick bush near the frontier is crossed the
country resembles Northern Nigeria again, with park bush and broad
open spaces, both cultivated and grass-grown. The villages are of
the usual Central African type; the groups of conical huts are
surrounded by millet stores, raised on legs like gigantic
bee-hives, to contain the grain cultivated in the clearings around
the settlements. The inhabitants are Hausa and Kanuri, though of
late years a number of lower-caste Tuareg from Air have settled
there as well. There is a considerable amount of rock outcrop in
the form, round Zinder, of low peaks with great boulders, or, near
Gure, of hills which terminate abruptly in a cliff of red rock,
north of which is the district called Elakkos.</p>
<p>Through this belt of park bush runs east and west the road
recently levelled and rendered passable for light cars in the dry
season between Lake Chad and the Niger. The nomadic cattle-breeding
Fulani come into this zone from the bush to the north and south;
Maradi is a Fulani centre of some importance. A certain number of
this people also come to Tessawa, but the Hausa population here
have been at feud with them for many generations, and only the
advent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> of European
control has put an end to continual wars between the two
Emirates.</p>

<p class="space-above15">Tessawa lies in a shallow depression
which, like others further north on the way to Damergu, drain into
the Gulbi n’Kaba, an affluent of the Niger containing running water
only in its lower reaches in the neighbourhood of Sokoto. North of
Tessawa and Damagarim the land becomes more sparsely populated and
the bush thickens, except in the immediate vicinity of the
villages, which now begin to be tenanted in increasing numbers by
Kanuri. The bush contains herds of Fulani cattle and a certain
amount of game; there are two or three varieties of gazelle, some
bustard, guinea-fowl, ostriches and occasionally giraffes. The
vegetation becomes more stunted as progress is made northward and
large trees are rarer; the soil is sandy; rock outcrop is almost
completely absent. The configuration of the ground is difficult to
follow in the thick bush; the gentle slopes and valleys appear
generally to drain westwards, but shallow closed basins are
numerous. Plenty of water is obtainable in any of these depressions
a few feet below the ground; the larger groups of wells, usually
near the two or three hamlets of straw huts which form a village,
are the resort of the Fulani with their cattle during the dry
season. The vegetation and the general aspect of the country,
however, are still those of the Sudan.</p>
<p>Damagarim differs but little from the Tessawa landscape except
that the bush is thicker and there are fewer open spaces. East of
the boulder-strewn hills of Zinder the more ambitious elevations of
Gure are visible. Zinder itself consists of two contiguous towns;
like Tessawa and the Hausa cities further south, they are built of
red mud. Zinder is smaller than the analogous Nigerian cities.
Since 1921 it has had no Sultan. The French headquarters of the
Niger Territories till recently were situated here. In the past
Zinder was of some importance; although the main caravan track from
the north appears in the early days to have run direct to Katsina,
a branch from Damergu went by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_44">[44]</span> way of Zinder as soon as Kano grew in
importance. But in spite of the number and influence of the Tuareg
who used to make Zinder their headquarters, neither Damagarim nor
Gure has changed its essentially Sudanese character.</p>
<p>Within a few days’ march of Tessawa on the road north to Gangara
in Damergu, several interesting features were observable. At Urufan
village the Magazawa Hausa and Kanuri women were wearing the
ornament known as the “Agades Cross,” peculiar to the Air Tuareg,
in a simple as well as in a conventionalised form. Many of the
women exhibited almost Mongolian traits in their eyes and
cheek-bones. Their hair was done in what I believe to be a Kanuri
fashion, that is to say, in a low crest along the top of the head,
tightly matted and well greased, with a parting, or very often a
shaved strip on each side, running the length of the skull; over
the ears the hair was again tightly plaited and greased. Their
dancing was different from the practice in Nigeria: the women dance
with bent knees and a crouching body, so that the back is nearly
horizontal. They shuffle up to the drum band one behind the other,
the woman at the head of the line turning away at the end of each
movement to take her place behind. The absence of sedentary Fulani
influence is obvious as soon as music starts; the rattles and
cymbals made of segments of calabash on a stick, peculiar to the
Fulani in Nigeria, are not used.</p>
<p>Ethnically it is a very mixed area. In most cases each hamlet in
a village group is inhabited by a different people. Magazawa Hausa,
Kanuri from Damergu, and more recent Kanuri from Bornu predominate,
but there are also nomadic Fulani and semi-nomadic Tuareg.</p>
<p>This is the edge of the country called Damergu, which, on the
direct road from Tessawa, may be said to begin at the village group
of Garari in a small valley, tributary of the Gulbi n’Kaba. Just
before reaching the southern edge of the valley the thorn bush
suddenly ceases. In the hollow are two or three hamlets of Kanuri,
Bornuwi, sedentary Tuareg and Hausa with common wells in the valley
bottom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> Instead of
interminable thorn scrub just so high that nothing can be seen
above it, an open wind-swept plain of rolling downland covered with
yellow-gold grass appears in front. On the sharp African horizon to
the N. and N.E. are the blue peaks of Damergu, quite small and
humble, but clear cut against the sky-line with all the dignity of
isolation in a sea of waving sun-washed prairie.</p>
<p>Damergu begins and ends abruptly: as soon as the belt of bush
which surrounds it on all sides is crossed, the ground lies open to
the sky and visibility becomes good. There is no more suffocating
feeling in the world than marching through Central African bush.
The discomforts and disabilities of travelling are not compensated
for by any advantage except a ready supply of firewood. The
bushland around Damergu is particularly unpleasant. It is never so
tall that one may not hope to see over the top of the ugly stunted
trees at the next low rise, and never in reality low enough to
allow one to satisfy one’s passionate longing. Visibility is
limited to a few yards and one’s sense of direction is confounded.
It is infernally hot, because the undergrowth effectively shelters
one from any breeze. The country is uniformly rolling and
unbeautiful. A high proportion of the trees are of the virulently
thorny variety which arch over the rare paths and make life on
camel or horseback intolerable. Walking is equally distasteful, as
the ground is strewn with burr grass which enters every fold of
clothing and mortifies the flesh like hot needles. Camels get lost
pasturing, game appears in vast quantities and disappears before a
shot can be fired. There are scorpions, snakes, centipedes and
tarantulas, not to speak of bush folk who have an uncanny sense of
their own whereabouts, and of yours as well. They are armed with
poisoned arrows, and though I did not suffer from their unkind
attentions, the bush through which I passed north of Daura has a
bad reputation. There are vast areas with no accessible water in
the dry season, but when it rains the trees drip their moisture
down your neck. I know the particular and private hell which
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> in store for me
one day for the many misdemeanours I have committed. It will be to
wander eternally through Sudan bush in search of the desert, where
one may see what will bring happiness or oblivion at a distance and
where one may at least face Destiny in the open.</p>
<p>On each separate occasion when I entered Damergu, in the east
returning from Termit, in the west going north from Tessawa, and in
the north returning home by way of Nigeria, I experienced such a
sense of relief and pleasure at emerging from the bush as to dull
my perception of the really somewhat monotonous nature of the
country. The winding hollows flow more or less aimlessly east or
west, except in the Gangara area, where the drainage is definitely
westwards into the Gulbi n’Kaba basin. The general level of the
country is about 1700 feet above the sea. Except in the hollows
around the rain pools the country is devoid of trees or scrub.
Every here and there small groups of hills rise 300-400 feet above
the surrounding country. They are so far apart that the next system
only appears on the horizon. The black ferruginous outcrop forms
conical peaks or stretches of pebbly surface, which break the round
contours of the prairie. These little hills, set on a rolling
golden prairie of very wide prospect, are the great characteristics
of Damergu. The land is vast and generous in its proportions.</p>
<p>The hills of Gangara in the west mark the site of a group of
four villages called Zungu and Gangara close under the principal
peak, Malam Chidam to the east and Karawa to the south. The hills
are a series of cones rising a few hundred feet from the plain and
are connected at their bases; a series of gullies or ravines
clothed with little bushes descends from them; there are no cliffs
or great masses of bare rock; the slopes are covered with low
scrub. The Gangara hills divide the Gulbi n’Kaba basin from a wide
depression on the east which sweeps south towards the cone of
Zawzawa near the large village of Kallilua, with Dambida and Mazia
not far to the north. North and east of Gangara are the low hills
of Dambansa, Birjintoro and Ollelua, while further<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> east again in a confused medley
of aimless valleys are Mount Ginea and the triple peaks of Akri.
The Akritan<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a> hills are a landmark for the towns of Jajiduna,
Tanut and Gamram. These various groups are the signposts of
Damergu; even a raw traveller can learn them in a short time.
Between the more important villages and towns the scattered hamlets
are of such frequent occurrence that, once the general lie of the
land has been observed, travelling is easy.</p>
<p>It is a country of considerable potential wealth. It was known
in the past as the granary of Air; even now great quantities of
grain are exported to the north and to the more densely populated
Hausa countries of the south. The long, broad downs, usually well
fed by the summer rains, are admirably suited for growing millet
and guinea corn. The surrounding margin of bush, especially on the
northern side within reasonable distances of the plentiful water
holes in open places, is full of the cattle of nomad Fulani and the
camels of the Damergu Tuareg. The cultivable area to-day is limited
only by the scarcity of population and some lack of enthusiasm for
work. A periodic cycle of dry years with the inevitable sequels of
drought and famine can only be guarded against by administrative
measures, which have not been enforced since the fall of the
Central African Empires. One after another they dominated this part
of the world, but whether Melle, Songhai, Bornu or Sokoto was
pre-eminent in the Central Sudan, Damergu remained an appanage of
Air, whose destinies it followed and of which it is economically a
part. After the first arrival of the Tuareg from the east, a
progressive descent of other tribes from the north led to the
establishment of a reigning class in the country, recruited among
the People of Air. To them the sedentary Kanuri people, who then
and since have constituted the majority of the population, were
subjected. The Tuareg Sultans of Damergu in the early period of
modern history ruled in Jajiduna, Gamram, Tademari and Demmili.
Even when they fell under the political influence of Tessawa or
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> Damagarim or were
conquered by Melle, Songhai or Sokoto in turn, they remained in
close touch with their relations in the north. The economic
necessity of keeping open the great caravan road to Tripoli, which
was a source of wealth to the Tuareg and to the south alike, was
realised by everyone.</p>
<p>The more intense cultivation and thicker population of earlier
days are proved by the profusion of deserted sites all over the
country, where the passing of the villages has left no more
tangible, if unmistakable, evidence than acres of cleared and
levelled ground strewn with potsherds and heaps of stones. The
greater population of those days and the administrative ability of
the empires of the Sudan combined to counteract the effects of dry
years by creating proportionately larger reserves of grain, which
were so conspicuously absent just before the late war that a severe
drought brought about wholesale emigration to the Southland.</p>
<p>The present-day villages in Damergu are all of the grass hut
variety of the usual African type. In the past a few towns appear
to have been built of mud. The ruins of old Dambiri show a walled
mud-built town, although Demmili, once the seat of a Sultan who
probably moved to Gangara when his village fell into decay, must
have been wholly built of grass, for it has entirely disappeared. A
lonely tree on a barren patch of ground marks its passing. The
Gangara villages are all straw built, as are, among the larger
settlements which have survived, Mazia and Kallilua. There are mud
buildings, I believe, at Tademari and Jajiduna, and certainly at
Tanut. The latter is the French centre of the country. It has an
important grain market and a fort containing a small garrison of
Senegalese troops. The principal native place was Jajiduna, where
the first French post was established; but the town has rather
declined since the move of the official capital to Tanut, where the
water supply for caravans is better. At Jajiduna there is a Senussi
“zawia,” one of the few points where the influence of this sect has
taken root in Tuareg countries. The principal Senussi<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> “zawia” in the Southland is at
Kano, with another smaller one reported at Zinder.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>North of Jajiduna and north-east of Tanut is Gamram,<a id=
"FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
a town of some importance in the past for the Tuareg, and the seat
of one of their rulers of Damergu. Now a small collection of straw
huts is surrounded by the ruins of mud walls like any of the towns
of Hausaland. Gamram was the Warden of the South on the marches of
the desert. As the most northerly permanent settlement of the Sudan
on the Tripoli road it became a point of vital strategic importance
for the caravan traffic. The town has occupied many sites on the
edge of a basin that becomes a lake in the rainy season. The
present site is on the north side, but the most important
settlement was probably to the south-west. The beauty of Gamram
struck Barth very forcibly. It was the first definitely Sudanese
settlement to which he had come after the inhospitable deserts and
the mountains of the Sahara. He had suffered intense discomfort in
the waste called Azawagh, intervening between Damergu and the
Sudan, but when he came to Gamram, the rains had filled the lake
which laps the feet of some immense acacias that are perpetually
green. Their roots live in water, and when the pool dries up, wells
only a few feet deep are dug under their shade. The trees are
filled with the song of many birds and the sound of running
lizards. The gardens around the edge of the basin produce
vegetables and luxuries rarely encountered in the Sahara. There are
eggs and chickens and milk and cheese in the market. All these
things are found at Gamram, not in plenty but in just sufficient
quantities to delight the traveller in barren lands. I came to
Gamram a day after leaving the impenetrable bush of Elakkos and
found it as good as Barth had described.</p>
<p>The town has lost its Tuareg character. It is now a small
settlement of a few hundred Kanuri and mixed inhabitants. The
Tuareg element in the immediate neighbourhood is accounted for by
some sedentary serfs or slaves living in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_50">[50]</span> other hamlets near by. The noble Tuareg of
the Isherifan tribe who used to possess Gamram wander in the
district between this place and the bush of Guliski. They have not
counted for very much since they were decimated in a raid by
Belkho, the great leader of the Air Tuareg during the latter years
of last century. Belkho had complained that the Isherifan at Gamram
were interfering with the caravans which crossed Damergu, and as
his people were especially interested in the traffic, he demanded
an assurance that the annoyance should cease, failing which he
would have to take measures. The Isherifan returned an insolent
reply and Belkho warned them again. He offered to accept a fine in
camels for their misbehaviour, but when this was refused, collected
a body of some two hundred to three hundred men and came swiftly
down the road from Tergulawen with hostile intent. He reached the
town at nightfall. Next morning he fell on the Isherifan, who had
prepared for the attack, defeated them, and carried off so many
camels that each of the victorious participants, as one explained
to me, secured five female beasts for his share. Since then, my
informant remarked, “the Isherifan are not.”</p>
<p>Damergu has been the scene of many bloody raids in recent times.
At Farak, one day from Gamram, a great assemblage of men and camels
from the Southland, bound for Ghat, was caught by the Imuzurak
under Danda. Merchandise and camels were looted and the personnel
was massacred.</p>
<p>During the four years which elapsed after the journey of the
Foureau-Lamy Mission took place in 1900, a series of important
events occurred in Damergu which ultimately led to the occupation
of Air. In July 1900 the French military territory of Zinder-Chad
had come into official existence, with a base of operations under
Colonel Peroz at Say, and subsequently at Sorbo Hausa, on the
Niger.<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> In February 1901 Colonel Peroz set out towards
Lake Chad. Sergeant Bouthel, left in command at Zinder by Lieut.
Joalland of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Voulet Mission, entered Damergu, defeated the Imuzuraq tribe of
Tuareg at Tademari or Tanamari and killed their chief, Musa. His
place was taken by his brother, Danda, who became ruler of the
country, while a third brother, afterwards killed at Bir Alali
(Fort Pradie) east of Lake Chad, in January 1902, with the
assistance of the Senussi organised Kanem against the French. Of
all the Air Tuareg, the Kel Owi confederation of tribes alone, on
account of their commercial relations with the Hausa countries and
with the north, adopted a pacific attitude. The rest of the Air and
the local Tuareg in Damergu set about fortifying Tademari, Jajiduna
and Gamram and raided as far afield as Zinder. Their defeat by
Sergeant Bouthel had so little effect that they soon plundered a
Kel Owi caravan at Fall near Mount Ginea. The French in consequence
were forced to occupy Gidjigawa near Kallilua in southern Damergu,
and finally, when the Farak massacre occurred, Jajiduna itself,
where a fort was built and a nucleus of camel corps established.
The latter, however, was restricted in its action to a small area
north of the post; operations did not even extend to Farak, only
thirty odd miles away. The effect of this French expansion was
nevertheless to make many of the prouder Tuareg, who would not
submit but foresaw the inevitable, move eastwards. Some of them
migrated as far afield as Kanem and Wadai, others only to Elakkos.
It was the continuation of a movement which had begun after the
advent of the Foureau-Lamy Mission. But even east of Chad the
ubiquitous white men arrived; the migrants fought the French with
conspicuous success at Bir Alali on two occasions, though they were
finally defeated. Of these Tuareg of the Exodus, some returned to
Air, but the rest moved yet further east to the strange land of
Darfur, where they still live in voluntary exile near El
Fasher.</p>
<p>The repeated attacks on the north- and south-bound caravans in
Damergu induced the French to escort the larger convoys of 1902 and
1903 as far as Turayet on the borders of the Air mountains. The
departure of the irreconcilables<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_52">[52]</span> towards the east, whence only a part was to
return after the third encounter of Bir Alali, and the gradual
penetration of the Southland, with the consequent pacification of
the population, left the Imuzurak alone in Damergu in open defiance
of the French. But in the meanwhile a second pillage had taken
place at Farak, and, moreover, in Air itself the situation from
every point of view was most unsatisfactory. The Sultan of the Air
Tuareg was tossed about between the important Kel Owi confederation
and their pacific policy on the one hand, and the irreconcilables
of Damergu and Air on the other. In Gall in the south-east of Air
had become a head-quarters of the raiders, and the Sultan began to
find his position intolerable. He concluded by inviting the French
to enter and take over. The occupation of Agades took place in the
autumn of 1904 by a camel patrol under Lieut. Jean, when the modern
history of Air and Damergu commenced.</p>
<p>Osman Mikitan, the Sultan of this critical period, lies buried
in a square tomb of mud bricks in the Zungu hamlet of Gangara. He
had changed places three times with Brahim as Sultan of the Air
people, and died unregretted because he had sold his country to the
foreigner.</p>
<p>The Tuareg of Damergu number among their tribes factions of many
of the most famous Air clans. The Ikazkazan are represented by the
section known generically as the Kel Ulli, the People of the Goats;
these tribes include the Isherifan of Gamram and the Kel Tamat, in
addition, of course, to many others in Air. The Imuzurak round
Tanamari, with the Imaqoaran, Ibandeghan, Izagaran and Imarsutan
are tribes which seem to represent the earliest Tuareg stock in the
neighbourhood; some of them certainly belong to groups which, when
the first migration into the plateau from the east occurred, never
reached Air at all. The omnipresent Ifoghas reappear in Damergu
near Tanut and roam northward; they are apparently cousins of the
great division of the Ifoghas n’Adrar (Ifoghas of the Mountains),
whose centre is around Kidal, north-east of Gao on the Niger. These
Ifoghas of Damergu also I believe<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_53">[53]</span> to have been left here in the course of the
westward migration of the first wave of Tuareg, though some of them
may have returned east after the initial movement. The Tamizgidda
of Air apparently also had a section in Damergu in Barth’s
day:<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class=
"fnanchor">[51]</a> their name connects them with “the mosque,” and
they are said by this explorer to have been regarded by the Arabs
in his day<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class=
"fnanchor">[52]</a> as “greatly Arabicised, having apparently been
settled somewhere near a town.” A tribe of the same name occurs in
the west; they also may be remnants, powerful as they were in
Barth’s days, of a westward migration from the Chad area, or
possibly of a returning wave which is known to have reached Air.
The Tegama in Damergu, says Barth,<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> “form at present a very
small tribe able to muster, at the utmost, three hundred spears;
but most of them are mounted on horseback. Formerly, however, they
were far more numerous, till Ibram, the father of the present
chief, undertook, with the assistance of the Kel Geres, the
unfortunate expedition against Sokoto. . . .” But this fighting
certainly occurred at a more recent date than 1759, when, according
to the Agades Chronicle, they were at war with the Kel Geres. Barth
adds that they were said originally to have come from Janet, near
Ghat, that they were already settled in the south long before the
Kel Owi came to Air, and that they are found on the borders of
Negroland in very ancient times. Ptolemy speaks of a Tegama people
beyond Air towards Timbuctoo and the middle Sudan. Hornemann, from
what he heard of them, “believed them to be Christians,” says
Barth; though the only reference I can find in this authority is to
the fact that they were probably idolatrous. I think Barth’s
reference is to a generic group, now called the Kel Tegama, a
collective name for the people living in the southern part of the
area known as Tegama, which is on the west side of the northern
borders of Damergu. Among the Kel Tegama<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> to-day would be classed the Damergu Ifoghas
and other tribes already mentioned. I fancy Barth has used a
generic local and geographical name as a tribal name.</p>
<p>The belief that they were Christians is, however, particularly
interesting. It is possible that these Tegama were not Tuareg at
all, and that Barth’s informants may have been referring to the
nomadic Fulani who pasture their cattle in the area where he met
them, round In Asamed and Farak, though his description of the time
spent in their company certainly points to their having in reality
been Tuareg. Their “customs showed that they had fallen off much
from ancient usages,” for not only did the women make advances to
the eminent explorer, but even the men urged him to make free with
their wives. He adds that the women had very regular features and
fair skins and that the men were both taller and fairer than the
Kel Owi, many of them dressing their hair in long tresses as a
token of their being Inisilman or holy men (“despite their
dissolute manners”), a peculiarity which connects them with the
Ifoghas of Azger, who also are a tribe of “marabouts.”<a id=
"FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
His general description of the Tegama, taken in conjunction with
their hunting and cattle-herding habits, corresponds so closely
with the appearance of the Ifoghas of Damergu to-day that there is
little doubt that Barth is referring to them, and that he should
consequently more accurately have written, not “the Tegama” but the
“Kel Tegama.” He distinctly states that they acknowledged the
supremacy of the Sultan of Agades rather than that of the Kel Owi
leaders, which will be seen to point to their early origin in the
country. Normally resident in Northern Damergu, they move to Tegama
and Azawagh after the rains to feed their cattle, goats and camels.
The conquests of the later Tuareg immigrants reduced them to a low
stage of poverty and degradation, though they have retained their
nobility of caste, race and feature to a remarkable degree.</p>
<p>The history of Damergu shows clearly the predominant<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> rôle which the Tuareg played
among the lower-caste Kanuri sedentaries and the nomadic Fulani.
The prepotency of a noble race among people of inferior class is
one of the most interesting phenomena of history. The Kanuri in
Damergu are, and probably have always been, numerically the
stronger; they are armed with bows and arrows, the weapon <em>par
excellence</em> for bush fighting. The Tuareg was less numerous at
all times, but everywhere, except in the west, where he has been so
long associated with the Sudan as to lose his nobility, disdained
any weapon but the sword, knife or spear. Like the knight in
medieval Europe, the Tuareg has always held that the <em>armes
blanches</em> were the only weapons of a gentleman, yet with all
these disadvantages his prestige was sufficient to ensure an
ascendancy which would have continued but for the advent of the gun
and gunpowder. In Damergu this prestige ensured the maintenance of
the Tuareg Sultanates until the advent of the French. In the
Southland all legends continue to magnify his prowess.</p>
<p>In Hausaland, at Dan Kaba in Katsina Emirate, a strolling player
came one day to give a Punch and Judy show for the delectation of
the village people, who were in part Hausa, in part sedentary
Fulani, and in part nomadic cattle-owning Fulani. The old
traditional play had been modernised, and although it was full of
topical allusions to the Nigeria of 1922, enough of the past
remained to show the reputation and moral ascendancy which the
Tuareg enjoyed in the Southland. The showman’s apparatus was
simple: divesting himself of his indigo robe, he arranged it on the
ground over three sticks and crouched hidden beneath its folds. He
had four dolls in all and worked them like those in our Punch and
Judy shows in England. In the place of the squeaky voice of the
Anglo-Saxon artist he used a bird whistle to conceal his words; the
modulations of tone and inflexion in the dialogues and
conversations between the puppets were remarkable. The Tuareg doll
is the villain of the piece: his body is of blue rags, most
unorthodoxly crowned with a white turban and armed with a huge
sword and shield.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Divested of the latter and crowned with a red turban, the same doll
in the course of the play becomes the “dogari,” or native policeman
of the Hausaland Emirs. The King of the Bush is a Fulani man,
impersonated by a puppet made largely of orange cretonne with huge
hair crest and bow and arrow. He suspects his wife, made of the
same material but ornamented with cowries before and behind, of
having relations with the Tuareg. She soothes and pets and sings to
her suspicious husband, playing music on drums and calabash
cymbals. Her mellifluous tones finally persuade him to go out
a-hunting in the bush. Needless to say, in Act II she flirts
outrageously with the attractive Man of the Open Lands, but is
surprised by her husband <em>in flagrante delicto</em>, most
realistically performed, whereupon, in the next act, a tremendous
fight ensues. The King of the Bush, discarding his bow and arrow,
fights with an axe, the Tuareg with his sword. The latter is
victorious and kills the King of the Bush. The wife calls in the
“dogari” to avenge her husband and to please her Southland
audience. In Act V the Tuareg is haled off before the British
Political Officer, presented in khaki cloth with a black
basin-shaped hat like a Chinese coolie and the face of a complete
idiot. In the ensuing dialogue the fettered Tuareg scores off the
unfortunate white man continuously, but, as all plays must end
happily, he is condemned to death. The execution of the plot is
good, the technique admirable, although the performance was unduly
protracted for our tastes. The one I witnessed lasted nearly four
hours. The predominant rôle is that of the envied and handsome
villain, the noble Tuareg. He is glorious in life and fearless in
death.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately impossible for lack of space to discuss the
Kanuri or Fulani of Damergu. The latter affect the political life
of the country but little. They shift continually to fresh tracts
of bush or better water for the sake of their great black cattle,
which used to be sold in the far north as well as in Hausaland.
They do not mix with the Tuareg, though they are recognised by
them, as anyone must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
recognise them, to be of a noble race. Slender, fine-featured, but
dark-skinned, with the profiles of Assyrian statues, the Damergu
Fulani are of the Bororoji section of this interesting people
which, in the course of its sojourn and gradual movement along the
fringe of the Sudan from west to east, has provided the ruling
class in most of the Hausa States. The recent history of Sokoto, of
Katsina and of Kano is their history. Their conquest of power in
Hausaland is but another instance of the ascendancy of nobility and
a glaring contradiction of the Socialist theory of equal birth.
When they came to power they were illiterate and pagan and had no
political virtues; their success was due to breeding and caste.</p>
<p>The Bororoji are a darker section of the Fulani than many of the
purer divisions in the south. In Northern Damergu they can be seen
stalking through the bush with their herds of black kine, naked
except for a loin skin and a peaked cap of liberty of embroidered
cloth, but patently conscious of their birth. They come and go as
they please, and no one interferes with them. Some may settle in
towns or villages, living for a time on the produce of sales of
cattle, in which they are rich. Most of them have no permanent
habitation. A few can be seen in villages like Gangara, where they
come to sell an occasional bull and buy a few ornaments or some
such luxury as grain. Their women are slender, tall and straight,
with fine oval faces and straight, jet-black hair. The triangular
form of face from the cheek-bones to the chin is noticeable among
the Bororoji as among the Rahazawa Fulani of the Katsina area, but
the face is somewhat longer in proportion to the breadth than
further south. Their appearance is Semitic, though the nose is
never heavy but straight, and this is the case even more among the
women than the men. Both sexes wear bead necklaces; the peaked
cloth cap is the ornament of the men. The women have anklets and
bracelets of copper and as many as six large copper curtain rings
in their ears, the only disfigurement of their handsome faces. Of
the customs, religion and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_58">[58]</span> organisation of the Bororoji little is known.
Like their cousins in the south, they anoint the wide-branching
horns of their cattle, and when they drink milk, though none must
be spilled, a little is left in the bottom of the calabash as an
offering to the Eternal Spirit. The Fulani believe that one day
they will return to the East, whence their tradition says that they
came, but how or why or when they left this unknown home has not
been explained. Obedient to tradition, numbers of them are settling
year by year in the Nilotic Sudan.</p>
<p>The last belt of bush between the Sahara and Sudan is reached a
day’s march from Tanut. The Elakkos bush further east ceases
completely in about Lat. 15° 20′ N.; on the road to Termit the
vegetation becomes very scanty some way south of a belt of white
sand dunes in Lat. 15° 30′ N.: north of them the country is pure
steppe desert. The Damergu bush, however, extends as far north as
Lat. 15° 50′ to the Taberghit valley on the eastern road to Air,
and to Tembellaga on the western road. Damergu forms a salient in
the line of the Sudan vegetation.</p>
<p>The belt of sand dunes on the way to Termit is said to run
eastward even beyond the Bilma-Chad road south of Agadem well, and
gradually to broaden all the way; in the west it hardly reaches the
edge of Damergu. Some fifty miles north of Talras in Elakkos the
same zone of acacia trees, which occur in the hollows of the dunes
on the Termit road, follows a depression called the Tegama
valley.<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a> The surface, like that of the steppe desert, is
of heavy buff-coloured sand in long whale-back dunes.</p>
<p>The Northern Damergu bush is different to the belt which runs
along the southern side of the country. The trees and shrubs are
principally of the acacia variety. The larger vegetation which is
typical of the Sudan has disappeared, but the grasses and ground
plants are still characteristic of the south. The burr grass which
makes life burdensome to the traveller reigns supreme. The
“Karengia” (<i>Pennisetum<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_59">[59]</span> distichium</i>) grows in clumps or small
tufts some fifteen inches in height. In Northern Damergu the ground
is densely carpeted with this grass. As soon as the summer rains
are over it sheds a little seed with a crown of small sharp spikes.
Leather and the bare human skin alone afford the burrs no hold; any
other material seems to attract them irresistibly. In the presence
of this pest the bush natives have found the only solution, which
is to go almost naked; the clothed but unhappy European blasphemes
until he is too weary to speak. Water is the only remedy; it
softens the little burr and makes it possible to remove it without
disintegrating entirely the mesh of one’s apparel, but water in
this belt of land is scarce.</p>
<p>The next watering-points after leaving Gamram are Farak, and
Hannekar on the Menzaffer valley. The latter is now on the most
direct road to Air, since the slightly more eastern track from the
former point by In Asamed well to Tergulawen became impossible when
the latter well was filled in during the late war. At Hannekar
there is a large depression covered with thick undergrowth and
small trees standing in a pool of water which lasts for some months
after the rains. As the pool dries up, shallow wells are dug in the
bed. The water supply at Farak is all contained in shallow wells,
but as watering from them is a much slower process than sending
cattle and camels to drink at a pool, it is customary for the local
Tuareg and Fulani to stay in the Hannekar area as long as they can.
After the rains and until the wells are re-dug at Farak there is
consequently a period when there is practically no water there at
all, as Barth found early in 1851. Nevertheless, since the
permanent supply at Farak below the ground is greater than anywhere
else in Northern Damergu, it has come to be considered the real
starting-point of the eastern road to Air. Its importance as a
rendezvous for pasturing tribes as well as for north-bound caravans
explains the numerous disasters which have occurred there at the
hands of Tuareg and Tebu raiders.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>North of Farak is
a long hill falling away steeply on the side towards the wells. It
gave Barth<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a> the impression of forming a sharply defined
southern border to the desert plateau between Damergu and Air. The
existence of so marked an edge is, however, not borne out in fact,
for no similar escarpment exists west of it on the road north of
Hannekar, nor yet, as Foureau<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> points out, on the western
road to Air, by Abellama. The hill of Farak, like another smaller
one at Kidigi north of Hannekar, is an isolated elevation.</p>
<p>Permanent habitation used to extend about one day’s march north
of Farak, to the neighbourhood of In Asamed well, but after the
latter was filled in, which I understand occurred during the 1917
revolt, when Tamatut well, further east, and Tergulawen on the
borders of Air were also destroyed, Farak became the last village
of the Sudan. Neither in recent years nor of old, however, did it
ever possess the same permanency or importance as Gamram. Farak was
always liable to be deserted at a moment’s notice in times of
danger. To-day the skin and straw huts of the Ifadeyen and Kel
Tamat tribes are scattered about in the dense bush all over the
district. The camps change from year to year. When I passed this
way there were Isherifan near Guliski and Ighelaf south-east of
Gamram, Ifadeyen at Farak, and Ifadeyen and Kel Tamat at
Hannekar.</p>
<p>Since the more direct road from Farak by In Asamed to Tergulawen
has been abandoned, there is now no water for caravans between that
place or Hannekar and the Air plateau except at Milen,<a id=
"FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
which is one day south of the mountains. The present track from
Farak, after crossing the Tekursat valley at a point near the site
of In Asamed well, inclines slightly west and joins the direct
track from Hannekar to Milen, running almost due north and south.
The apparent angle made by the Farak-Milen track at In Asamed
puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> me when I
came to plot it on paper from a compass traverse, for the
extraordinary straightness of these old roads between important
points, even in the rough hill country of Air, is very remarkable.
I eventually realised that a line from Farak produced through In
Asamed was on the direct bearing of the old well of Tergulawen.
This disused track is the original southern end of what is called
the “Tarei tan Kel Owi,” or Kel Owi road, in other words, of the
main caravan track from Tripoli to Nigeria. The road in Air and in
the south is usually called among the Tuareg after the
confederation of tribes in control of the way. Down this eastern
track came Barth and his companions in 1850-1.</p>
<p>In Asamed, meaning in Temajegh “(The Well) of Cold Water,” was
just over 100 feet deep; its existence shows that Damergu has been
left behind and Azawagh has begun, for the former is a land of rain
pools and shallow and seasonal wells, while the latter, north of
the last Sudan bush, is a desert country with occasional very deep
wells and no surface water. It is called Azawagh, a Temajegh name
applied to several semi- or totally desert areas in the Sahara. The
fact that it is not confined to the country south of Air must be
borne in mind in seeking to identify the various areas referred to
under this name by the Arab geographers. There is, for instance, an
Azawad, a name corrupted in Arabic for Azawagh, north of
Timbuctoo.</p>
<p>North of the broad Tekursat valley, with scarcely any marked
channel and sparsely covered slopes, is a low plateau with three
small valleys, rejoicing in the uncouth name of Teworshekaken.
Beyond is the Inafagak valley, and finally the smaller and probably
tributary valley of Keta. From here to the Taberghit valley the
bush thins out more and more; patches of bare sand become frequent,
and the trees are considerably smaller. In none of these valleys
has the rain-water left a definite bed of flow, though dry pool
bottoms and short sections of channel may be seen here and there.
The valleys are sometimes several miles from side to side; they
were probably in the first instance longitudinal
depressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> between
heavy sand dunes formed along the direction of the prevalent wind;
the sides are even now of too recent formation and too permeable to
spill the rain-water into definite beds along the bottoms.</p>
<p>At the southern edge of the immense Taberghit valley the
character of the country changes quite definitely. The surface
becomes dotted with little hummocks where the sand has been washed
against a small bush or piece of scrub; otherwise the ground is
bare. The few trees are grouped in scattered clumps. The ground
vegetation is no longer predominantly “Karengia,” but one of
several kinds of less offensive and more useful desert grasses
impregnated with salt. The best camel fodder, curiously enough, is
the true desert vegetation. The animals eat it avidly on account of
the salt it contains, and even long periods of drought do not
conquer its obstinate greenness. Its nutritive power is greater and
it is more wholesome than the luxuriant Southland fodder.</p>
<p>At Taberghit a track runs direct to Agades by way of Ihrayen
spring. When both the eastern roads were in use, the Hannekar track
was used by people going to Agades, while the more eastern Farak-In
Asamed route by way of Tergulawen was frequented by caravans bound
for Northern Air.</p>
<p>A day before reaching Milen well you feel very strongly that the
Sudan lies behind. The last bush has been left near Taberghit. In
front is an open depression perhaps five miles wide and not more
than fifty feet deep: it contains no stream bed, but here and there
patches of dry cracked mud indicate the formation of short-lived
rain pools. East and west the same stark valley runs as far as eye
can see. Its course is clearly defined and it is without
intersecting basins or tributaries or curves. On the far crest are
loose buff-coloured sand dunes and then a few small acacias. The
levels gradually rise in a series of folds, one of which contains
the closed basin and disused Anu n’Banka<a id=
"FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>;
another forms a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
valley called Kaffardá, which is like Taberghit but on a smaller
scale. The folds lie parallel to one another along the line of the
prevalent E.N.E. wind which always blows in Azawagh. This wind is
one of the peculiarities for which the country is notorious. Both
times I crossed this region it was blowing with great violence. In
June it was suffocatingly hot; I camped one noonday to rest out of
sheer exhaustion in a group of trees on the northern side of
Taberghit. There was practically no shade: the leaves of the
stunted trees were too thin to shelter even three persons. The
temperature was over 110° F. in the shade, and visibility did not
exceed a quarter of a mile, owing to the blowing sand and dust. Six
months later I returned the same way. The same wind was blowing,
but it was so cold at midday that I was unable to keep warm, even
walking, with two woollen shirts, a drill coat, a leather jerkin
and a blanket over my shoulders. Where a bush or sand dune offered
shelter from the wind the sun was quite hot, but that night the
thermometer fell to 31° F., after having registered 92° F. at 3
p.m. in a sheltered spot in the shade. It was very unpleasant.
Barth’s experience of the wind and cold of Azawagh was much the
same as mine. He writes: “The wind which came down with a cold
blast from the N.N.E. was so strong that we had difficulty in
pitching our tent;”<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a> it was responsible for the most
“miserable Christmas” he had ever spent. I was there a few days
before Christmas in 1922 and can vouch for the accuracy of his
verdict. Even the blinding glare and heat of June were preferable
to the bleak cold of the winter nights.</p>
<p>One effect of the constant wind is that the longitudinal dunes
in Azawagh have retained their characteristic form more generally
than further south. Their gentle rounded contours, which the wind
tends to restore whenever the rain happens to have modified them,
are characteristic. There is, of course, less precipitation here
than further south, though it has been sufficient in Tagedufat to
produce a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
considerable growth of desert vegetation along the bottom of the
valley, where there are a number of small trees and an abundance of
every conceivable type of salt bush and grass. It is said at
certain seasons of the year to produce the finest camel fodder in
this part of Africa.</p>
<p>All over Azawagh are numerous deserted sites where millet used
to be grown on the sandy slopes. The people who cultivated this
arid country lived in temporary tents and huts except further north
between Tagedufat and Milen, and consequently no trace of their
dwellings remains. The evidence, however, of cleared and levelled
patches and of broken earthenware is as unmistakable here as in
Damergu. Between Keta and Tagedufat there is a succession of such
clearings. It is borne in upon one that this heavy buff-coloured
sand country where only desert vegetation now appears to thrive is
in reality quite fertile so long as it receives any rain at all.
The climate has probably not altered enough in recent times to
account for the desertion of Azawagh; it seems rather to have been
due to a decrease of the population. The Kel Azawagh, according to
tradition, were numerous at a time when Damergu was thickly
peopled, and there was not enough land available there or in Air to
satisfy the needs of a people squeezed between the south and the
north, whence the population was constantly being driven into the
Sudan. It is clear that the Kel Azawagh who made these millet
cultivations in a zone of desert steppe must have been of a fairly
sedentary disposition, for a nomad people would have contented
itself, as the modern Tuareg inhabitants of Azawagh do, with
grazing herds and flocks on the excellent pastures.</p>
<p>In referring to the Kel Tegama a plea was advanced that the name
was primarily a geographical one, and one not properly appertaining
to a single tribe. The name Kel Azawagh, to which the same
considerations certainly apply, is found to some extent
interchangeable with Kel Tegama. Now it will be shown later that
the Tuareg of Air and Damergu only reached these lands
comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> late in
history; consequently an allusion in Ptolemy to a Tegama people
appears to refer to a non-Tuareg folk in this or some other area of
the same name. I see no reason to doubt that it was these Tegama
and Azawagh areas which were meant by Ptolemy, and therefore
conclude that before the Tuareg arrived they were possessed by a
people to whom the millet clearings and village sites are probably
due. The later Tuareg Tegama, or Kel Tegama, as we should more
properly say, as well as the Kel Azawagh, were merely a section of
People of the Veil who later lived in the areas, and in the course
of time were named after them, though it is possible that the name
Azawagh was one given by the Tuareg to an area previously called
Tegama by its former inhabitants.</p>
<p>We shall see<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a> that among the ancient divisions of the
People of the Veil in the Hawara group is a Kel Azawagh. The
peculiarities of the Hawara clans would not connote any sedentary
instinct in this tribe, whether it lived in this or in another area
called Azawagh; but when we find in the Tetmokarak tribe of the Kel
Geres group now living near Sokoto (whither they migrated from Air
through this Azawagh area) a subsection called Tegama, and when we
have learnt<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a> that the Kel Geres are almost certainly a
Hawara people, we can be even more inclined to the view just
suggested regarding the use of the names Azawagh and Tegama and the
origin of the people at various times living there. As a tribal
name Kel Azawagh has now disappeared. The French 1/2,000,000 map
displays it in the valley between Agades and the Tiggedi cliff, but
out of place, for when still in use it was applicable to an area
rather further east. Although it is no longer a proper name, it
serves the Ifadeyen who now live in Azawagh for a descriptive term
of themselves in accordance with the usual practice regarding local
tribal nomenclature.</p>
<p>In the periods between the rains the village sites in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> Taberghit or
Tagedufat valleys watered at the deep wells of Tagedufat, Anu
n’Banka, Aghmat, Taberghit and presumably Tateus, though I know
nothing of the last named. All these wells have now become silted
up by wind-borne sand, but could easily be cleared if the
population returned, as the water has not disappeared.</p>
<p>The whole area between Taberghit and Tagedufat is covered with
small mobile dunes; the two valleys themselves are, however, free
of them. There is no loose sand at all in the Tagedufat valley, a
curious phenomenon probably connected with the eddies formed by the
prevalent wind in the channel of a depression between the higher
banks. If this were true, the existence of dunes at Kaffarda would
conversely point to its being an isolated basin, and this indeed is
probably the case. Anu n’Banka is in a little hollow, the sides of
which are also covered with small dunes. The bottom itself is
clayey and free from blown sand, showing traces of having been a
rain-pool at certain seasons. Surrounding the depression are millet
clearings and a little rock outcrop. It is the most southerly point
in Azawagh where stone occurs, and the outpost of the more
conspicuous rock formations of the Tagedufat valley.</p>
<p>Although the first part of the descent into Tagedufat is
imperceptible, the appearance of the ground has changed
considerably on account of the small crescentic dunes of very fine
white sand which overlie the heavier buff-coloured sand of the
surface. The crescentic type is characteristic of young dunes in
process of formation,<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a> their last stage being the long
whale-back down of heavy particles which tend to settle or become
cemented and eventually to support some vegetation. The Azawagh
valleys present a series of interesting examples of the youngest
type of dunes, which are still moving rapidly, superimposed upon
the oldest fixed dune formations oriented along the line of the
prevalent wind. It is curious that at no point has the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> fine and very mobile sand which
is continually being carried in from the great Eastern Desert
collected in large masses: the small crescentic bodies, the horns
of which, of course, lie down wind, or, in other words, point west
to south-west, are neither continuous nor contiguous. The
underlying buff-coloured surface is covered with a number of small
trees and scattered scrub or grass in isolated clumps. This
vegetation becomes covered by the crescent dunes and in time
uncovered as the white sand moves westward. Where this vegetation
can be seen emerging from the crescentic formations on the windward
side it is still alive, pointing to a fairly rapid motion of the
body of sand. It is true that some of this desert scrub is
sufficiently hardy to withstand a period of, it is said, as much as
four years without any rain, and even then it only requires very
little moisture in the air or some dew; the numerous small acacias,
however, if wholly engulfed for any length of time, would die. Yet
at no point is there either a wake of dead vegetation behind the
larger crescentic dunes or even an unduly large proportion of dead
trees. The progress of the small dunes is therefore undoubtedly
rapid, and is due to the constant wind, which should, however, have
tended to create larger masses. The crescentic dunes are rarely
more than twelve feet high at the most; their individual area is,
of course, relatively large owing to the very flat slipping angle
of the fine grains. Barth records dunes as far as Tergulawen; but
there is no evidence regarding the country east of this
point,<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class=
"fnanchor">[64]</a> which is probably too far north of the dune
belt on the Termit road to be connected with that zone.</p>
<p>The Tagedufat valley bottom, unlike the Milen and Taberghit
valleys, is marked by a more continuous stream bed along which
water flows every year for a short time during the rains. The most
remarkable feature of the valley is a series of flat bare patches
formed by the pools of rain-water; they are of no great size, but
the surface is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
stained bluish-white by chemical incrustation. The Milen and
Taberghit valleys, while possessing a few similar rain-pools, none
of which survives for more than the briefest period, do not exhibit
this complexion. The point is of particular interest in connection
with a report given to me by my guide, Sidi, who was with me on the
way south. He is a widely travelled and knowledgable man. He stated
that the Tagedufat depression extended eastwards across the desert
all the way to Fashi, and was marked along the whole of its course
by such patches of chemical incrustation. My travelling companion,
Buchanan, observed that the ground shortly before reaching Fashi
was stained in the manner described. In the open desert, where in
the immensity of space it is difficult to determine the direction
of a very slightly accentuated valley, such noticeable features are
valuable evidence.</p>
<p>Considering the size of the Tagedufat basin south of Milen, the
valley shown as extending towards Termit on the French 1/2,000,000
map and called Tegemi (Téguémi), is perhaps a confluent, or even an
inaccurate representation, of the main valley itself. A recent
Camel Corps<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a> reconnaissance from Talras to Eghalgawen
possibly followed up one such affluent in the east bank of the main
channel of Tagedufat. The importance of the Tagedufat valley from
the hydrographic point of view cannot be over-stated.</p>
<p>Directly the Tagedufat valley is crossed the rock outcrop on the
north bank becomes a striking feature. Increasing in size towards
the west, it falls away below the surface to the east. Crescentic
dunes reappear between the outcrops and continue almost all the way
to Milen. On the north side of Tagedufat, near the track, for which
it serves as a landmark, is a prominent mass of black rock called
the Kashwar (Stone) n’Tawa or Tawar. Far away to the N.N.E. the
relief becomes bolder, rising to a group of small summits clothed
with loose sand, called the Rocks of Oghum. The remains of some
stone houses, at one time the southernmost<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_69">[69]</span> permanent settlement of Air, appear in the
loose sand near the hills. North of Oghum in a little depression
filled with acacias is Gharus n’Zurru.<a id=
"FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
After a further stretch of dunes a small valley running northwards
diversifies the general lie of the ground. It is called Maisumo,
and contains another deep well which is still in use. This valley
after a short distance runs into the Milen depression, with the
conical hill of Tergulawen visible to the east and the little
massif of Teskokrit to the west. The northern part of the latter
group extends eastwards from the main summits as a steep ridge
forming the northern bank of the Milen valley itself.</p>
<p>East of Tergulawen again is a small and almost unknown group of
hills called Masalet, where in recent years Kaossen, afterwards
leader of the Air revolt in 1917, dug a well. It only yielded
brackish water, which, though good enough for camels, proved too
medicinal for the Tuareg, who filled it in again. It had been dug
for political purposes largely in order to facilitate parties from
and for the Southland participating in the yearly caravans which
fetch salt from Bilma. Masalet was designed to obviate these
parties making a detour along the River of Agades or via
Eghalgawen: it provided an easterly watering-point in Azawagh
corresponding with Tazizilet further north in Air itself. The
unsatisfactory nature of the supply, especially for caravans
engaged in crossing the eastern desert, did not, however, justify
the risk of leaving so remote a watering-point available for Tebu
raiding parties. The fact that Masalet was constructed in recent
years is interesting, as showing that the Tuareg have not lost the
art of locating deep water.</p>
<p>The western road from Tanut to Agades via Aderbissinat and
Abellama runs over much the same sort of country as that which I
have just described between Farak and Milen. Aderbissinat well,
seventy-five miles from Tanut and ninety-three miles from Agades,
is a point of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
strategic importance that the French from Zinder built a fort there
during the war in order to secure their communications with Air. It
has not been garrisoned of late, but proved of paramount importance
during the operations of the column which marched from the south to
relieve Agades during the rebellion of 1917. With the exception of
the deep but copious well of Abellama, there is no useful permanent
watering-place between western Damergu and Agades, as the spring of
Ihrayen in the Tiggedi cliffs has too small an output to provide
for many animals. Nineteen miles north of Aderbissinat the bush
ceases. As at Taberghit further east, the country rises some 200
feet to an average level of 1700-1800 feet above the sea. Beyond
Timbulaga sand dunes appear on the level buff-coloured steppe,
which is covered with the usual scanty vegetation of desert grass
in tussocks.<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a> The ground then slopes gradually down to the
deep well of Abellama in Lat. 16° 16′ 30″ N. and Long. 7° 47′ 20″
E. G. Abellama as a stage corresponds with Milen on the other
road.</p>
<p>On the easternmost or Tergulawen road Barth<a id=
"FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
shows that the country is again substantially the same. South of
the “spacious” well, which is in a depression “ranging east and
west,” with sand-hills on the south side bearing a sprinkling of
desert herbage, the country is covered with small dunes on a “flat
expanse of sand, mostly bare and clothed with trees only in
favoured spots.” To the north is a great sandy plain running as far
as the Ridge of Abadarjan, where the level descends to the upper
basin of the River of Agades. The area is covered with “hád,” the
most nutritious of desert plants and the most characteristic of the
desert steppe of Africa. In all parts of the Sahara the
distribution of the plant marks the division between the Desert and
the Sown. This “hád” of the border line advances or recedes,
sometimes from year to year, according to the rainfall. It is the
tidal mark of the desert.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>The northern part
of Azawagh is geographically important, as it contains the
transverse valleys which collect the southern rainfall of Air and
carry it westwards into the Niger basin. The course of the Beughqot
(Beurkot) and Azelik<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69"
class="fnanchor">[69]</a> valleys is wrongly shown on the French
maps. They do not unite until they have reached a far more
southerly point than where they are shown to do so on the Cortier
map. Furthermore, when they have joined, they turn S.W. and not
S.E. A recent reconnaissance as far as Masalet proved that after
these two valleys meet they turn west into a large depression which
is probably the same one as that in which the well of Milen is
situated, though it might, on the other hand, be the Tagedufat
basin; this is a point which must for the moment remain undecided.
On a solution of this problem depends the answer to the question as
to whether Milen or Tagedufat is the principal basin into which the
Air valleys east of Beughqot as far as Tazizilet drain. All that is
clear is that they turn southwards and then westwards to join one
of the two systems in question, and do not peter out in the desert
as Cortier’s map suggests.</p>
<p>West of Milen well the valley in which it is situated eventually
joins the lower Tagedufat, which runs on S.W. or W. towards the
Gulbi n’Kaba or the Tafassasset-T’immersoi basin. That the
Tagedufat system does not enter the River of Agades over the
Tiggedi cliff at some point near Ihrayen is probable owing to the
fact that all this country has been subjected to a slight southerly
tilt. The Tiggedi cliff, the Eghalgawen-T’in Wana massif, the cliff
east of Akaraq and its continuation along the great valley, finally
represented by the ridge of Abadarjan, as Barth rightly judged, are
the northern boundary of this area, which slopes gently from north
to south. The River of Agades receives hardly any left-bank
tributaries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Milen well could
never be found without a guide. The wide valley, with sand dunes on
the south side and a steep north bank where the now omnipresent
rock of Air appears, is bare, dry and stony. It shimmers in the
heat. Teskokrit appears as a black mass in the west on a bank of
milk-white mirage set round a group of trees. The bottom of the
valley is a gravel plain with a small patch of bare rock in it
which an unwitting traveller would most probably pass unheeding. In
this patch of rock is a small hole with a large circular stone near
by. The hole, barely three feet across, is the mouth of a well
driven through hard sandstone all the way down to the water-bearing
stratum, seventy feet below the ground. The mouth can scarcely be
seen fifty yards away. The rounded stone is several inches thick
and was said to have been used to cover up the mouth of the well to
prevent its becoming silted up with driving sand.</p>
<p>I came there in June, after more than forty hours’ march from
Hannekar with four tired camels and two men, an Ifadeyen guide and
an Arab of Ghat in the Fezzan. We had very little water left, so
little, in fact, that it was all used in one pot to cook some rice
for us three. The place was deserted and very lonely. The wind was
driving the sand so hard that it stung the naked calves of my legs
as I stood at the well with Ishnegga the guide, drawing water for
the thirsty camels. Camels in hot weather drink a great deal, and
hauling water in a two-gallon leather bucket from a seventy-foot
well is hard work in a temperature of over 150° F. in the sun. The
camels drank interminably. The last and best camel was still
thirsty and remained to be watered. The beast was rather weak. It
had a bad saddle sore, a hole about the size of a large man’s hand,
in its back, and it was festering and full of maggots. We had all
just done a journey of over 500 miles from Tanut to Termit and
back, in thirty-five days, including nine days of halts, averaging,
in other words, nearly twenty miles per marching day for twenty-six
days. The camel had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
begun to drink. Then as we were drawing a full bucket the well rope
broke six feet from my hand and fell to the bottom of the well with
a splash. A vain hour was spent, while the rice cooked and got more
and more full of sand, trying to fish up the rope and bucket with
an iron hook made of the nose-piece of a camel bridle fastened to a
knotted baggage rope. This too was lost after hooking the tangle,
which it joined at the bottom of the well. Prospects looked gloomy
as our thirst increased. I have distinct recollections of the sky
and valley getting whiter and more metallic and the heat more
intolerable. Finally, just enough rope was found by untying all the
baggage to ladle up water a half-gallon at a time in a small canvas
bucket. But the poor camel had to wait a long time to finish its
drink, for the first of the supply to reach the top was used to
refill the tanks.</p>
<p>As I was leaving the well two men with three camels came in from
the south. They had started to return to their own country in the
hills, after an enforced sojourn in the neighbourhood of the fort
at Tanut on account of their rebellious propensities in 1917 and
1918. They had no possessions but three young camels, and had
started with only enough water in one small skin for half their
journey. The two men reached Milen, having drunk nothing for
twenty-four hours. They were rather exhausted, but had fully
expected to have to do another ten or twelve hours’ march the same
night to the nearest water at T’in Wana, as they had only a
calabash bottle and no rope with which to draw any more water. They
had risked death sooner than stay a moment longer than was
necessary in the south, even to collect enough well rope or
equipment for a journey which most Europeans would consider
difficult. It was very pleasant to give these two men, an old noble
and his serf, some especially good cold water from a small canvas
cooler which I had prepared. When the serf carried away a pan of
icy water, he first offered it to his master, who drank it.</p>
<p>The second time I came to Milen was in December.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> There was such a crowd of people
and of flocks belonging to the Ifadeyen watering that the supply
was practically exhausted, and it took me five hours to get enough
water for the return journey to Hannekar. But in June the camping
grounds were deserted, for there was hardly any pasture during
those last few days before the rains.</p>
<p>The deep wells of Azawagh fall into two categories. The narrow
wells, like Milen, Aouror, higher up the Milen valley, and Maisumo,
are intended primarily for watering flocks. Their output is copious
but slow, and not unlimited. Not more than two buckets can draw
water comfortably at the same time: for watering flocks where time
is not important and the animals can be brought in from pasture in
small batches, these wells are adequate. Tagedufat, like
Tergulawen, on the other hand, was a caravan well; it was broad and
capable of watering a whole caravan rapidly. It became silted up
with drifting sand, like the pasture wells, Anu n’Banka and Gharus
n’Zurru. Of Aghmat, Tateus and Taberghit I have no details, but
when Barth passed this way no stop was made at either of the first
two, which were on his road. The supposition is that unless these
wells were dug since his day, which is not likely, as the
population of Azawagh had by then already decreased, they also were
intended for pastoral purposes. They are now all silted up.</p>
<p>The theory that the wells of Azawagh were made by the Ifadeyen,
who have only recently come into this area for winter pasturage,
was advanced to me, but my informant, who joined my caravan as an
unbidden but welcome guest at Milen on my way south, was himself a
member of this tribe, so the information is prejudiced. The wells
are certainly very old and are probably the handiwork of the denser
population which cultivated millet and had its permanent villages
in the Taberghit and Tagedufat valleys. The pasture wells were
regarded as the property of the tribe in the area, and now,
therefore, of the Ifadeyen. The big caravan wells were under the
tutelage of the keepers of the great highway to the south, the Kel
Owi confederation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and before them, therefore, of their predecessors in Eastern Air.
These big wells were always considered to be free for passing
caravans to use without let or hindrance at any time, except in the
event of a feud being in progress between the Kel Owi and the
owners of the caravan. Caravans, on the other hand, using pasture
wells, could only do so with the permission of the tribe pasturing
in the area. The latter, conversely, had no rights over the great
wells. The maintenance of these rights is the origin of
confederations like the Kel Owi, for the freedom of the great wells
is a vital necessity to a society of caravaneers, and has to be
retained by force if necessary. It accounts for such raids as those
conducted by Belkho on Gamram, where the Isherifan had interfered
with passing caravans just once too often.</p>
<p>One of the Azawagh wells, Aouror, has been the object of much
dispute among the Tuareg: there are inscriptions on a neighbouring
rock recording the ownership and, to some extent, the history of
the well. It would be attractive to think that “Aouror” meant the
“Well of the Dawn.” It is not impossible, since Arorá or
Aghorá<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a> means “dawn” in Temajegh, and Aouror is almost
the easternmost well of Azawagh. Like Milen, it is driven through
the rock, but is only some four fathoms deep. Like Milen, too, its
sides are scored by rope-marks which in places have cut deep into
the hard sandstone. Wet ropes covered with sand of course cut into
rock quite rapidly, but even so the antiquity of these wells must
be considerable. The rock cutting, which no Tuareg to-day is
capable of executing, is perfect; the walls are perpendicular and
smooth; the plan is a perfect circle.</p>
<p>Abellama and Aderbissinat in the west of Azawagh are deep
caravan wells with good water; the former is in friable soil, and
has a tendency to fall in.<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> These two, with
Aouror,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> Maisumo and
Milen, are the only live wells in Azawagh to-day.</p>
<p>After a short gentle slope up, the ground descends from the
ridge on the north side of the Milen valley in a series of long
terraces to a basin, the lower part of which is known as the
Eghalgawen valley. It joins either the River of Agades at the
south-west corner of the T’in Wana massif, or turns south-west
towards the Milen and Tagedufat basin; my own impression, based on
native sources which are not wholly reliable, inclines to the first
view. East of the watering-point of Eghalgawen, the valley runs in
a fold, into which flows one of the Southern Air valleys. The
actual stream bed is wide and well marked by the heavy annual flood
which it carries away from the hills of Eghalgawen and T’in Wana.
In character the lower part of the valley along the foot of the
hills, with its short tributaries from this little massif, belongs
to the Air plateau, and not to Azawagh. The vegetation in the bed
is dense and heavy. Dûm palms (<i>Cucifera thebaica</i>) and large
trees appear. Geographically and geologically the Air plateau has
already commenced at the rocks of Tagedufat: actually, however, it
is not reached till the River of Agades is crossed, for Eghalgawen
is still held to be in Azawagh.</p>

<p>The cliff of Tiggedi, with its continuation eastward for some
way beyond the Eghalgawen hills, is the southern shore of a wide
valley which serves as a catchment for all the waters of Southern
Air that do not escape by the south-east corner of the plateau into
the Azawagh valleys previously described. The cliff is a geological
phenomenon of great interest. At the point where the Abellama road
descends into the valley some forty miles south of Agades the cliff
is sheer for a height of over 200 feet. The path down from the
general level of the desert to the dry alluvial plain, which forms
the bottom of the River of Agades, is steep and rough. Standing at
the top and looking east and west, it seems like a cliff on the
sea-shore broken by capes and small inlets; the illusion of
maritime action is remarkable. Westwards<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_77">[77]</span> at Marandet, though still a definite feature
of the area, it is less abrupt; erosion has broken down the
precipice, while the Marandet torrent has eaten away a ravine
leading even more gradually up to the level of the desert.
Eastwards, on the other hand, the cliff continues unbroken as far
as the Eghalgawen and T’in Wana massif, where higher hills above
the desert level take the place of the cliff itself. Though they
form a salient in the line, their abrupt northern slopes continue
the eastward trend until they come to an end near Akaraq, where the
cliff reappears. Here again it is absolutely sheer, if somewhat
less elevated; it is broken by a narrow inlet where the Akaraq
valley, the only tributary<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of any size on the south
bank of the River of Agades, enters the main basin. At this point
the cliff assumes the most fantastic form. The sandstone has been
shaped by erosion into pinnacles and blocks of the strangest
shapes. The Akaraq valley itself runs back like a cove in a
cliffbound sea-coast; both banks are nearly vertical, decreasing in
height as the level of the bottom gradually rises to the desert,
where the bare rock has been deeply cut into by the water, lying in
a semi-permanent pool in a very narrow gully. The bottom of the
inlet is covered with luxuriant pasture and some fair-sized trees,
while at the mouth, in the main valley, stands an island of rock
with vertical sides to complete the illusion of a sea-coast.<a id=
"FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
From the top of the cliff you may look across the great broad
valley toward the mountains of Air that are scarcely visible in the
north. No defined bank appears to limit the far slope of the basin.
There is deep green Alwat pasture<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in the nearer distance,
merging imperceptibly into yellow grass and bare sand further
away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> The blazing
glare and shimmering heat wash the feet of the cliff where a
shelving beach of loose white sand has been thrown up against the
rocks. The plateau at the top of the cliff is quite flat, and
covered with a layer of small hard gravel over the rock. It is
without any vegetation.</p>
<p>The great valley bears several names. At the Akaraq inlet it is
called Tezorigi. Opposite the Eghalgawen massif it is the T’in
Dawin, and further west the Araten valley. West again it has no
name, but where it finally leaves the mountains of Air for the
Assawas swamp on the way to the T’immersoi basin, the natives call
it the Ighazar n’Agades, or River of Agades, from the city which
stands on its northern shore, and this is the name I have adopted
for the whole. How far the cliffs extend eastward I do not know. A
great fork in the valley is visible from Akaraq, the channel is
divided by a bluff promontory, but the cliff continues along the
southern bank of the southern branch until it is lost from sight.
The ridge of Abadarjan which Barth crossed north of Tergulawen, I
expect, is part of the same formation.</p>

<p>Maritime action is highly improbable as the origin of the cliff.
No traces of shells or beaches at different levels, to be accounted
for by a receding sea, have been noticed. The supposition that all
the Sahara was once a sea-bed is untenable, and in any case
maritime action would hardly be limited to a few small areas such
as this one. It seems easier to look for another explanation. The
cliff and the Eghalgawen massif are a sandstone formation, but the
Taruaji mountains of Air opposite the little Eghalgawen-T’in Wana
massif are granitic. The cliff represents, I hazard, a fault north
of which the igneous formation of the Air plateau has been
extruded. The ground to the south slopes gradually away from the
edge of the cliff, accounting for the virtual absence of any
tributaries on the left bank of the River of Agades. There is
apparently no igneous rock south of the basin, there is very little
else to the north of it, with the exception of some Archean and
very early rock. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
fault, occasioned by the volcanic action which formed the massif of
Central Air, erected a barrier to the southward drainage of the
mountains, and the waters of Southern Air were diverted westward. A
larger rainfall than now caused the gradual silting up of the area
between the bottom of the fault and the southern part of the
mountains. As the ground level rose and became an alluvial plain
from which practically only Mount Gadé and the island off Akaraq
emerge, the rain floods began to wash along the cliff and eroded
the sandstone into the fantastic forms which are now seen.
Wind-borne sand from the eastern desert completed the process of
shaping the rocks. The accretion of alluvium diminished with a
decreasing rainfall in Air, and the surface deposit of wind-borne
sand formed what is now in dry weather a hard gravel-covered plain
which, in the rainy season, turns into mud-flats and becomes almost
impassable. The water flows aimlessly in the alluvium along
deep-cut gullies with vertical sides that constantly change their
course. The alluvial origin of the plain of the River of Agades is
unmistakable.</p>

<p class="sch">THE CITY OF AGADES</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> Eghalgawen massif contains a number
of watering-points. The pool of Eghalgawen is near the junction of
a valley sloping down from the hills, the main valley here assuming
the name of the watering-point. Abundant water exists all the year
round under the sand in the bed near a low rock on the left bank.
It has rather taken the place of Tergulawen well as a <em>point de
passage</em> for caravans on the Great South Road, and used in the
past to be a favourite resort for caravan raiders. The neighbouring
hill, like the one at Tergulawen, is a well-known watch-tower in
times of trouble, since both of them command the approaches to a
strategic point.<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a> T’in Wana, Tarrajerat, Tebehic and some
pools in the Isagelmas valley on the southern periphery of the
Eghalgawen massif, are watering-points for the camels and flocks of
the tribes which range over Azawagh, to-day the Ifadeyen. Their
winter camping grounds can be seen all the way from Tagedufat to
the River of Agades; they are readily distinguishable from the
older permanent settlements of the original Kel Azawagh who grew
millet in this area. Besides the Ifadeyen, the Kel Giga section of
the Kel Tadek use the Eghalgawen hills and Azawagh pastures very
considerably after the rains. The Ifoghas of Damergu rarely come so
far north, since, having few camels, they lack incentive to seek
these superlative desert pastures. Those members of this tribe whom
I saw in Azawagh were typical in possessing only donkeys and goats,
which of course will eat almost anything.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>After a 560-mile
excursion to Termit and Elakkos, I rejoined my travelling
companions, whom I had forsaken at Tanut, in the little massif on
the south side of the River of Agades. They were camped a short
day’s march from Milen, at the famous permanent pool in the T’in
Wana valley. Of all pools in Africa it is of T’in Wana that I shall
keep the pleasantest recollections. I was greeted by a fusillade of
welcome and immediately went for a swim in the deep pool that had
recently been filled by the rains. The channel cut by the water in
the rock was in places fifteen feet deep. The pool had a sandy
bottom, with a rock four feet high at one end for a diving
platform. A length of twenty yards was clear to swim in, and then
came a succession of smaller pools beneath the arches and
overhanging sides of red and black rock. The erosion of the
sandstone was most remarkable. There were witches’ cauldrons and
buttresses and enchanted caves, with deep crannies in the tall
vertical sides. In the wide valley above, masses of green bushes
and branching palms seemed to make the place a heaven-sent garden
of rest in a hot land. We were all very happy, and the camels were
improving fast. Our men were delighted to see the mountains of Air
again. My guide from the south, Ishnegga, who was of the Ifadeyen,
found relations in a neighbouring valley. There were acquaintances
on the road to gossip with and discuss. Poor Ishnegga shot himself
accidentally some months later, as I heard from his beautiful old
mother, whom I had met at Hannekar and saw for a second time on my
way home.</p>
<p>The sides of the T’in Wana ravine were covered with T’ifinagh
inscriptions relating to the tribes that had pastured here in their
time; they recorded the names of people, messages to and from their
friends, and the professions of love of their men and women. The
low hills behind were rough and without vegetation or soil; but
some mountain sheep, gazelle and sand-grouse subsisted on the
coarse grass in the ravines. The sandstone of the massif seemed to
have been subjected to volcanic heat. A deposit of
fossil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> trees among
the rocks and boulders was found: a specimen piece picked up near
Akaraq a few miles north-east had probably been brought from this
deposit near T’in Wana. It was identified on my return as a
Tertiary conifer, but the siliceous replacement had been too
complete to permit of more detailed examination, except by
microscope.</p>
<p>A very pleasant camp was eventually broken, and Tebehic, on the
north-west side of the hills, with two watering-places, was reached
after crossing the Isagelmas valley, a collector for several small
rivulets draining the western side of the hills. In spite of an
attack of malaria, which overcame me, Tebehic proved most
interesting, for I made friends with a family of Ifadeyen who were
camping there during the rains. The man had some cows and supplied
me with fresh milk, a great luxury after camel’s milk and the
condensed sort out of a tin. He was a widower with several
children, and quite charming. One of the children was suffering
from a severe abscess in the right ear. It had been “treated” by
blocking the orifice with a paste made of fresh camel dung and wood
ash mixed with pounded leaf of the pungent Abisgi (<i>Capparis
sodata</i>) bush. I suppose the mixture was intended to act like a
mustard poultice, but the discharge from the abscess being unable
to escape had been causing the child acute pain, which it was easy
to relieve by clearing out the mess and washing the ear. The
abscess having previously opened of its own accord, the pain ceased
almost as soon as the “remedy” had been removed. It was the first
of my “cures” as a doctor among the Tuareg, and laid the
foundations of a great reputation!</p>

<p class="space-above15">After a few days at Tebehic we proceeded
to cross the broad plain of the River of Agades, whither one of my
companions had preceded me. Memories of that plain are unpleasant.
A day’s march from the shelter of the Tebehic valley we were
overtaken by a violent thunderstorm right out in the open just
south of T’in Taboraq. As a convalescent cure for malaria, designed
to make any reputable European doctor shudder, I recommend
getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> up after
three days in bed, marching six hours on a camel in the sun, and
then spending two more holding up a tent in company with four other
men in an eighty-mile-an-hour storm with a rainfall of
three-quarters of an inch in about half an hour. The exertions of
five of us were successful in keeping the tent up and the baggage
dry, but proved tiring. As soon as the wind was over the five human
tentpoles were turned on to canalisation, which soon became
necessary to drain away the deluge. When this passed, a search over
the countryside had to be instituted for articles of equipment
carried away by the storm. The camp stove, an unwieldy cube of
sheet-iron some fifteen inches each way, and weighing nine pounds,
was found 3000 yards from the camp. But the storm had been
magnificent. It had commenced at about 3 p.m. as a black cloud
hanging over the Air mountains in the north. The wind, before it
acquired full force, bore along a cloud of orange sand gleaming in
the sun, which was still uncovered by the blue-black storm above.
Suddenly everything seemed to be going on at once, sunshine,
sand-storm, wind, purple squalls and a white uniformity of tearing,
sweeping rain. By six o’clock it was all over. The sun set in a
pale yellow sky behind the T’in Wana range. The northern hills grew
slate-coloured and then black, and the storm went rolling on into
Damergu, illuminating the night with lightning. Hitherto my worst
experience of rain had been at Guliski in Damergu, when myself,
three natives and our baggage lay in a hut nine feet in diameter;
it rained all night, and slowly flooded us out. One felt the water
rising among the blankets in an atmosphere of damp clamminess and
native humanity. Then had come a hopeless dawn, but the air soon
dried everything. Yet I had still to learn what storms in the
mountains could be like.</p>
<p>The north side of the River of Agades opposite Tebehic has no
definite bank. The mountains of Air slope gradually down to the
valley; they are intersected by larger and smaller valleys, forming
a series of roughly parallel right<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_84">[84]</span> bank tributaries all in close proximity to
one another. The widest of them are the Azanzara, Tureyet, Amidera,
Teghazar and Telwa, most of which start north of the Taruaji
mountains—the Tureyet and Telwa, in fact, have their head-waters in
the Bagezan and Todra groups in Central Air. Some small villages
lie among the foothills by these valleys, but it is dull country. A
few small ill-grown trees and a little grass are all the vegetation
on the succession of gravel patches which constitute the plain. The
sight of the mountains of Air in front makes one want to hurry
on.</p>
<p>South of one of these villages the opening tragedy of the 1917
revolution took place. A platoon of French Camel Corps, after
completing their duties as escort to the Bilma salt caravan, had
supervised the dispersal of the camels in their various tribal
groups at Tabello, east of Bagezan, and were returning to Agades
for a rest. They had been away perhaps a month and now were within
a day’s march of the city. They knew nought of what had happened in
Air, suspected absolutely nothing of the unfriendly disposition of
the Tuareg. Near T’in Taboraq a large force of Tuareg, which had
been lying in ambush behind a little hill on the northern edge of
the plain, fell on the column as it was beginning its last day’s
march into Agades post. A running fight ensued, in the course of
which nearly the whole platoon of Camel Corps were destroyed. One
officer, who was returning to France on leave, escaped southward,
and a few wounded Senegalese “tirailleurs” found their way with
difficulty into the fort at Agades, which had been attacked early
one morning a day or two before while the garrison was out on
parade. The revolution had been prepared for some time, with the
connivance of the Sultan of Agades, by a Tuareg noble named
Kaossen, an inveterate enemy of the French since 1900. The outbreak
had been proposed by Kaossen and aided by the Senussiya and hostile
elements in the Fezzan and Tripolitania as part of the anti-French
and -British activities which continued in North Africa throughout
the European war. The development in Air, however,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> came as a surprise to the
French. All the Tuareg in the plateau rose, and although the
garrison at Agades held out for over three months in doubt and in
complete isolation, the revolt spread into Damergu and fears were
even entertained for the safety of Northern Nigeria. The defence of
Agades and the arrival of a column from Zinder, acting in
conjunction with another column from the Niger, eventually saved
the situation. The heroic resistance of the garrison at Agades and
the magnificent work of the military organisation of French West
Africa, over these huge expanses of country at the end of 1917 and
early in 1918, have probably never even been heard of, still less
recognised, in England, where events nearer home at a most critical
period of the war obscured the issue of “another minor incident in
the Sahara.” The column from Zinder, in spite of a severe check on
the way, was the largest single body of men ever successfully sent
over a desert against a nomadic people. It is my privilege to
record in England, I think for the first time, the courage of those
gallant French soldiers who indirectly defended Nigeria. Their
efforts in Air saved a British colony from facing a situation which
might have become serious owing to the general depletion of forces
there, as elsewhere during those tragic months of the Great War. I
am happy to make this acknowledgment, both as tribute to the French
soldiers whom I had the pleasure of meeting during the Great War
and in 1922, and particularly because even in Nigeria the gravity
of the 1917 revolution has never been sufficiently recognised.</p>
<p>My route over the plain of the River of Agades lay in sight of
Mount Gadé, a flat-topped hill standing alone to the south. The
track used by parties from Sokoto passes this conspicuous landmark
after crossing the Azawagh on the way to the rendezvous of the
annual salt caravan at Tabello, under the eastern slopes of Bagezan
in Central Air. After cutting this track we joined the
Agades-Tabello road somewhat west of T’in Taboraq. East of this
village the road passes through the other settlements which lie on
the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> spurs of
the Taruaji massif before it turns north to Tabello.</p>
<p>The track now entered and wound along a valley called the
Teghazar.<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class=
"fnanchor">[76]</a> The small torrent bed was very sodden after the
rain of the previous day. On either side were low hills of bare
gravel with some rock outcrop beginning to appear here and there.
On the low scarps or patches of loose stones a few ragged acacias
had secured an existence, marking the foot of the Air hills along
the River of Agades. Eventually the track rose up to the level of
the highest undulations and we came in sight of Agades. Almost
simultaneously two Tuareg on camels appeared on the road. They had
been sent out from Agades with an accumulation of letters, months
overdue, and a message to say that we were the guests of the French
officers in the fort, about a mile north of the city. As the last
fold of ground was crossed, by a steep bluff where Kaossen had
constructed a military work during the siege of the French garrison
in 1917, the whole length of the city came in sight on a low ridge
to the south-west. The far end was marked by the stately tower of
the Great Mosque, unchanged since Barth saw it more than seventy
years ago. Straight ahead lay the French post, surrounded by a
defensive wall flanked by blockhouses and containing the tall masts
of a wireless station, near the wells of T’in Shaman in a
diminutive plain where the Foureau-Lamy Expedition had camped over
twenty years earlier. In 1917 there was no W/T station and scarcely
any fort; the buildings were all disconnected and scarcely
defensible.</p>

<p>The city of Agades used to be surrounded by mud walls, intended
to baffle raiders rather than to withstand a siege. The distance
along the line of their elliptical circumference, so far as it can
still be traced, is a matter of three and a half to four miles. The
wall has been much broken down and in some places is hard to find;
its perimeter and plan seem to have varied from time to time
according to the number of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87">[87]</span> inhabitants. The best preserved parts are to
the north-west beyond the Great Mosque, and to the north, where
gates may be seen; there has evidently been considerable decay even
since 1850.<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> At a distance the whole ridge on which the city
stands appears covered with low, earth-coloured houses, for the
most part without an upper storey. The regular sky-line is scarcely
broken save by a few dûm palms and tenuous trees rising above the
uniform level of the roofs. Only the tower of the mosque, like a
finger pointing up to heaven, soars over the drab habitations.
Their dull uniformity seems to enhance its dignity.</p>
<p>Agades is not a Tuareg city. Its foreign aspect is at once
apparent. Although it also struck Barth immediately, he was,
curiously enough, not so much concerned with what is really the
most obvious feature of the alien atmosphere as he was with the
foreign language and origin of most of the people he met there. His
wanderings perhaps brought him less into contact with the permanent
settlements of the Tuareg in Air than my good fortune did me; he
could not otherwise have failed to remark that the houses in Agades
are those of a Sudanese town and not those of the People of the
Veil.</p>
<p>The most striking characteristic of the towns of the Sudan, of
the immense walled cities of Kano and Zaria, as well as of the
smaller places, is the mode of construction of the dwellings. There
are two types of houses and in neither of them is stone used. The
first type is the circular hut with a low vertical wall carrying a
conical roof; the fashion extends throughout Central Africa. This
abode is constructed of straw, or grass, or boughs, or of whatever
material is readiest to hand. The ground plan is circular unless
specific conditions have exerted a contrary influence, which occurs
rather seldom. In the more advanced settlements of this sort in
Northern Nigeria a development of the primitive form has taken
place: it is a much larger structure with vertical mud walls which
support the conical thatched roof,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_88">[88]</span> sometimes as much as twenty feet in diameter,
standing within a compound. In many North Nigerian villages the
dwellings consist exclusively of groups of such huts surrounded by
low walls or enclosures.</p>
<p>The second type of house in the large towns of the Sudan is
many-roomed and formless. The whole building, including the roof,
is made of mud and often has one or more stories. The flat roof of
mud and laths is carried on rafters of dûm palm wood which is one
of the only available trees that resists the invasion of the white
ant. Houses of this type often cover a considerable area, rambling
aimlessly hither and thither in rooms, courts and alley-ways,
according to the requirements and fancy of the owner or his
descendants. The mud construction at times displays architectural
features of real distinction. The thick tapering walls are wide and
smooth. The doorways have a pylon-like appearance reminiscent of
Egypt. The heavy squat façades are by no means unimposing: deep
cold shadows cast by angles and buttresses break up the surface of
the red walls. The broad panels around the doors are sometimes
elaborated with decorative mouldings or with free arabesque designs
in relief. The larger rooms which cannot be spanned by one length
of rafter are vaulted inside with a false arch of mud, concealing
cantilever timbering; the effect is that of a series of massive
Gothic arches, plain but often of noble proportions. Technically,
mud construction is easy, inexpensive and adequate in a climate
where the rainy season is short and well defined. Balls of mud are
dried in the sun and cemented together with wet mud. The outer and
inner walls are faced with a plaster of earth and chopped straw. In
the hot tropical sun the walls dry as hard as stone. The houses
survive for an unlimited period of time if the outside surfaces are
refaced every year after the torrential rains have washed away the
stucco skin. Roofs, of course, have to be carefully levelled and
drained to prevent the water accumulating in puddles and, in time,
soaking through the ceilings. Gutters are provided<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> with spouts projecting through
the parapets of the roofs to prevent the water running down the
sides.</p>
<p>The rambling mud house and the circular mud or straw and thatch
huts, grouped in compounds, together make up the towns and villages
of Northern Nigeria. The two types may be seen side by side, for
instance in the country between Kano and Katsina, where the Fulani
and Hausa population is mixed. It would be interesting to
establish, as <em>prima facie</em> seems to be the case, whether
the circular houses were those of the sedentary Fulani, who are
nearer the semi-nomadic state, and the more ambitious mud dwellings
those of the Hausa. In neither of these two types of house is stone
used, either as ashlar or as rough masonry. Nor do dry stone walls
occur, for mud is more convenient even when stone is
available.<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class=
"fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
<p>When the Tuareg, on the other hand, builds permanent or
semi-permanent dwellings, he displays characteristics which at once
differentiate him from the people of the south. His straw and
matting huts are not of the Central African type; they have no
vertical wall of reeds or grass and a separate conical roof; they
are built in one piece as a parabolic dome. Another, movable, type
of hut or tent consists of a leather roof arched over four vertical
uprights surrounded by matting walls on a square plan. The
appearance of these tents is that of a cube with a slightly domed
top. The permanent houses in Air are regular, carefully built
constructions of stone and cement. In them mud is not employed
except where the fashion of the south has been directly copied in
comparatively recent times. The rambling house plan of the south is
almost unknown. The Tuareg dwelling has a definitely formal and
rectangular character. It rarely consists of more than two rooms.
Even the exceptions to this rule<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> display considerable
differences from the southern type of house.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Both the temporary
huts and the permanent dwellings of the People of the Veil,
therefore, are intensely individual. They differentiate the Tuareg
sharply from the southern peoples. But even a casual glance at the
houses of Agades makes it obvious that they belong to a city of the
south. There is plenty of stone all round the city which might have
been used for building, yet nearly all the houses are rambling mud
constructions like those of Kano or of any of the towns of Nigeria.
The number of houses at Agades which reflect the formal Tuareg
fashion of planning is small. The characteristics which one learns
to associate with the truly Tuareg houses of Air are conspicuously
difficult to find. When I was in Agades at the commencement of the
rains before the annual refacing of the walls had been carried out,
it was possible to observe the absence of stone building. An
inspection of the broken walls of the many ruined houses confirmed
this observation of the past. The number of pools in the town alone
was evidence of the prevalence and antiquity of mud construction;
Barth mentions the names of several of them. The borrow pits in the
Sudanese towns, where water accumulates in the rainy season and
rubbish is shot in the dry, are features which no one can escape,
were it only on account of the smells which they exhale; for in the
Sudan, even when stone is available as at Kano, it is not used. I
have vivid recollections of Agades at this season and was
particularly impressed by the efficiency of the spouts designed to
carry the water off the roofs. Progress was necessarily circuitous
in order to avoid drowning in the flooded holes and borrow pits,
while distraction was afforded by a determined but usually
unsuccessful effort to escape a series of shower-baths in the
narrow streets.</p>
<p>The ridge on which the city stands is surrounded by several
depressions where are the wells that supply the needs of the
population. In addition to those outside the town there were
formerly nine other wells within the walls, but, like the pools,
they were nearly all adulterated by the saline impregnation of the
ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>I cannot here
refrain from quoting Barth, whose capacity for meticulous
observation depended on never missing an opportunity, however
strange, of acquiring information. “The houses of Agades do not
possess all the convenience which one would expect to find in
houses in the north of Europe; but here, as in many Italian towns,
the principle of <em>da per tutto</em>, which astonished Goethe so
much at Rivoli on the Lago di Garda, is in full force, being
greatly assisted by the many ruined houses which are to be found in
every quarter of the town. But the free nomadic inhabitant of the
wilderness does not like this custom, and rather chooses to retreat
into the open spots outside the town. The insecurity of the country
and the feuds generally raging oblige them still to congregate,
even on such occasions. When they reach some conspicuous tree the
spears are all stuck into the ground, and the party separates
behind the bushes; after which they again meet under the tree, and
return in solemn procession to the town. By making such little
excursions I became acquainted with the shallow depressions which
surround Agades. . . .” He then proceeds to enumerate them.<a id=
"FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
The plain where the French fort lies is called Tagurast, that to
the S.W., Mermeru; to the S.E. is Ameluli, with Tisak n’Talle
somewhat further away to the S.S.E.; Tara Bere lies to the
west.</p>
<p>The city is divided into several quarters, the names of which
are recorded on Barth’s plan. The only two I heard mentioned were
Terjeman and Katanga, the former so called from the interpreters
who used to live in the neighbourhood, the latter from the market
where what Americans would term “dry goods” of the Air fashion are
sold. Little seems to have changed in seventy-five years;
necklaces, stone arm-rings, wooden spoons and cotton cloth can be
bought, now as then. In the larger market near by, called by the
Hausa name of Kaswa n’Rakumi (the Camel Market), live-stock of all
sorts is sold. The vegetable market seems to be as ill furnished
now as it was in 1850.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>I visited two or
three private houses. They were not imposing, lacking the
architectural features of the better-class houses in the Sudan. The
use of white and colour washes in the interiors and on the outside
walls was interesting. This practice is the only feature in which
the houses of Agades differed from those of the Sudan; it appears
to be peculiar in this part of Africa to the Tuareg, the habit
having, no doubt, been copied from the north. The pigment is made
of a chalky substance found near Agades, or of ochreous earths
occurring in various places in Air. One of the houses which I saw
was that of the Añastafidet, the administrative head of the Kel Owi
tribes. The rooms were small and ill-planned; there was no attempt
at decoration. The technique of the south had evidently not
flourished in the atmosphere of the Sahara. The two plans of
private houses reproduced by Barth give an idea of the rambling and
haphazard designing.</p>
<p>The most elaborate and well-kept house is the one which belongs
to the Kadhi, near the Great Mosque. It must have been here that
Barth attended several sittings of the Kadhi’s Court, adjudicating
on inter-tribal matters which could not be settled by the tribal
chiefs. It did not seem at all remarkable after the great houses of
the Sudan, but was perhaps rather better kept than most of the
other buildings in Agades. The people call it the House of Kaossen,
and his family still live there. He carried on his intrigues from
this place, and plotted with apparent impunity through 1917, until
the time was ripe for open rebellion. He had returned from the
Fezzan full of ambition to free his country from the white men whom
he fought all his life. He had taken part in the operations against
the French in Equatorial Africa, largely directed by the Senussiya
from their “zawias” in Tibesti and Ennedi. When this period of
hostility came to an end, but not before the French had sustained
several severe reverses, notably during the fighting at Bir Alali
(Fort Pradie), north-east of Lake Chad, Kaossen took refuge with
the Azger Tuareg in the Eastern Fezzan,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> raiding and fighting with these lawless folk
against their neighbours. Of his own initiative, but aided by the
Senussiya and their Turkish and German advisers, Kaossen returned
to his native country in 1917 with a small band of supporters to
drive out the French, an effort in which he very nearly
succeeded.</p>
<p>By far the most considerable monument of the city is the Great
Mosque. I was unable to visit the interior, but from the general
appearance of the building I am sure that I should have agreed with
the description of Barth, who wrote: “The lowness of the structure
had surprised me from without, but I was still more astonished when
I entered the interior and saw that it consisted of low narrow
naves divided by pillars of immense thickness, the reason of which
it is not possible at present to understand, as they have nothing
to support but a roof of dûm-tree boards, mats and a layer of
clay.” He goes on to speculate on the superstructure which these
“vaults or cellars” may have been designed to carry but which was
never completed. I do not think such speculation is necessary. The
description fits accurately every one of the seven or eight other
mosques in Air which I saw within and without. In none of them were
the walls ever meant to carry an upper storey. In all of them the
ceiling was low and the roof flat, with rows of massive pillars and
the naves running transversely from north to south across the
buildings, which were usually far broader than they were deep.</p>
<p>The Great Mosque of Agades as it stands to-day was built in
1844.<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a> It would hardly be remarkable were it not for
the minaret, which was rebuilt by the Sultan Abd el Qader in 1847
to replace the one which had fallen. From a base thirty feet square
resting on four massive pilasters in the interior of the mosque,
this four-sided tower of mud and dûm-palm rafters rises to a height
of between eighty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
ninety feet, tapering from about one-third of its height to a
narrow platform less than eight feet square at the top. Access is
obtained by a spiral way between the solid core and the outer wall,
which is pierced with small windows. From a little distance the
foreshortening produced by the tapering faces gives the impression
of immense height without accentuating the pyramidical form. The
four-square, flat sides are bound together by transverse rafters
projecting some three or four feet. These ends serve the purpose of
scaffolding when refacing is necessary after the rains, an
operation without which the tower would not have stood any length
of time. Near the mosque is a heap of mud, the remains of an older
tower called “Sofo,” presumably of the same type.<a id=
"FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class=
"fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p>The structure is properly speaking a minaret, but was used as a
watch-tower in time of war. It is not now used for either purpose.
The muezzin stands on the roof of the mosque below to call upon the
Faithful at the prescribed hours to forsake their pursuits and turn
to the only God. The Tower of Agades stands like a beacon, showing
far over the monotonous plains. I remember this solitary pillar
towering above a confused mass of low and ruinous buildings against
the blood-red setting sun, which appeared and disappeared in the
black clouds of an evening in the rains. The blue hills and sharp
peaks of Air were distant in the north; to the south lay a drab
plain, unbroken as far as eye could see in the gathering twilight.
The Tower seemed like the lonely monument of a decaying
civilisation.</p>
<p>There are said to have been as many as seventy mosques in and
near the city, but only two, I think, are still used. Outside the
walls to the S.W. there is a shrine known as Sidi Hamada, “My Lord
of the Desert,” appropriately named considering the barren nature
of the ground all round. It is an open place of prayer of much
sanctity, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> reputed
to be the oldest Moslem place of worship in the neighbourhood. The
Qibla is in a low bank, faced with a dry stone wall, which slopes
down to the level of the surrounding ground a few feet on each side
of the niche. On certain occasions prayers are said at Sidi Hamada,
notably on the Feast of the Sheep, known to the Tuareg as Salla
Laja, which I was fortunate enough to witness at Agades in June
1922.</p>

<p>It was made the occasion of much festivity. Every available
camel in the vicinity was ridden by a Tuareg in the gayest saddle
and bridle from the city to the shrine. These people do not feel
that they are making the best of themselves unless they are mounted
on a camel. A man and his camel are complementary and reciprocal to
one another. When there is an occasion to celebrate they wear their
best clothes and borrow any ornaments they can find to adorn their
sombre garments. They are vain of their personal appearance and
covetous of those pretty things which are considered in good taste,
but their unselfishness is nevertheless remarkable. I have seen men
forgo the real pleasure of wearing a silver ornament or a new face
veil in order to lend them to a less fortunate companion whose
general appearance was more ragged, or whose means and
opportunities did not allow him to secure anything to smarten his
turn-out. I had bought of the local jeweller-blacksmith in Agades a
number of small silver ornaments of the sort which are affected by
the Tuareg. All these, and even certain articles of clothing from
our own scanty wardrobes, were borrowed for the day. It was curious
to see that their sombre apparel was never lightened by any of the
coloured materials so much in evidence in the Sudan. The
best-dressed man is considered to be the one with the newest
indigo-cotton robe and veil of the traditional plain design. At the
most a red cloth is tied round the head over the face veil, or, in
the case of the guides employed by the French, around the waist and
shoulders: the robe must, however, always be plain white or dark
indigo. The Tuareg of our<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_96">[96]</span> own retinue picked out the best of our camels
to ride. They turned out a very smart patrol, the camel men Elattu,
Alwali and Mokhammed of noble caste, with two or three buzus or
outdoor slaves, and Ali the son of Tama, the Arab from Ghat.</p>
<p>At an early hour the poorer people on foot began to stream over
the tufted plain which lies between the place of prayer and the
city. They were followed by little parties of men on camels, black
figures on great dun-coloured or white riding beasts, girt about
with their cross-hilted swords, and some also carrying a spear and
oryx-hide shield. Finally, a larger group of men, preceded by three
or four horsemen, was seen approaching. They were the Sultan of
Agades, Omar, the Slave King of the Tuareg of Air, with his
attendants, and the Añastafidet, a noble of the Kel Owi tribes,
who, from the purely administrative point of view, is the most
important man in the country. They were accompanied by the chief
minister of the Sultan, the notables of the place, and other
dignitaries. Among them was El Haj Saleh, the father of our camel
man Elattu; he had performed the pilgrimage three times, in the
course of which he had acquired the Arab fashion of dress used in
the north. He wore the white woollen robe that is supposed to be
descended from the Roman toga, with his head covered only by a fold
of the cloth. El Haj Saleh has lived so long in foreign parts that
he no longer veils his face and prefers speaking Arabic, but he is
much respected as a learned and holy man; he is now employed by the
French at the fort as Oriental Secretary and interpreter. With him
were the Kadhi and the Imam, a solitary exception among the veiled
Tuareg in the matter of display, for he had obtained from the south
a buff-coloured silk robe embroidered with green. The Sariki
n’Turawa, or chief minister of the Sultan, came next; near him
gathered a number of Arab merchants from Ghat and Tuat in white
robes; with one or two from the extreme west, there were a dozen or
fifteen in all, who have the trade of Agades in their hands. Among
them I perceived one Arab from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_97">[97]</span> Mauretania, a little man with delicate,
sensitive features and a brown beard. He came straight up to where
I was standing to repay me a debt of five silver francs which he
had incurred some months before at Gangara in Damergu.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the crowd had collected, the men ranged themselves in rows
facing east before the Qibla; the women stood together on one side.
The Sultan and his party were immediately opposite the niche with
the Imam facing them. He began to read the Quran and the multitude
then prayed. On either side of the Sultan, as he knelt to make his
prostrations, a Tuareg remained standing with his sword drawn,
extended point downwards at arm’s length, in protection and salute.
As the Sultan rose to his feet the guard sloped their swords,
repeating the salute every time he bowed before the name of God.
These two men are distinct from the officials in the local
administration;<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> they are the personal body-guard of the
Sultan, chosen among the “courtiers of the king,” who are young men
selected in turn from the tribes in Air which owe allegiance direct
to the Sultan.</p>
<p>After the prayers were over two sheep were slaughtered in the
orthodox manner. Their throats were cut by the Imam, reciting the
invocation of Islam, and the blood was wiped away with holy water
to the accompaniment of suitable prayers.</p>
<p>The Sultan and the people then returned to the city, making a
detour by the N.W. side through the ruined suburb outside the walls
and past the Great Mosque to the present palace, an indifferent
building, both tumbledown and dirty. The reigning Sultan, Omar,
like all his predecessors, is of slave descent. He was chosen in
1920 by the tribes which have the right to elect him, from a
collateral branch of the ruling family. He is a weak man, and too
much in the hands either of interested advisers or of the French,
which does not always mean the same thing. His<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_98">[98]</span> predecessor, Tegama, on the other hand,
was a remarkable man. His intrigues with Kaossen were successful in
preparing the revolution in Air so quietly that practically nothing
was suspected of his intentions until the fateful dawn when the
black troops on parade at the post were fired upon from the
outskirts of the city. After the French columns had relieved the
besieged garrison, both Kaossen and Tegama fled east to Kawar,
whence the former found his way to the Fezzan, only to be killed,
so it is believed, in obscure circumstances north of Murzuk by some
Arabs. The native accounts of the story cast some doubt on his
actual death on the grounds that his body was never found among
those of his massacred companions. It is further represented that
the very Turks and Senussiya whom he had served put him to death
for his failure in Air, but it appears more probable that on his
way to seek refuge with the Senussiya in Cyrenaica, Kaossen and his
friends had the misfortune to fall in with a band of Arabs whom he
had raided in the olden days, and to have been killed by them.</p>
<p>The Sultan Tegama, on the other hand, betook himself to Tibesti,
hoping to find sanctuary among the Tebu, who, though the hereditary
enemies of the Tuareg of Air, were probably sufficiently hostile to
the French to be counted on to harbour any prominent refugee from
the wrath of the white man. By the influence of the Senussiya in
these parts he expected to reach Kufra and so take up his residence
among the malcontents who live in that remote land. Treacherous as
ever and true to their reputation current all over North Africa,
the Tebu entreated Tegama generously and took the first opportunity
which presented itself to hand him over to a French camel patrol
from Bilma. In the course of time he returned to Agades as a
prisoner under an escort of negro Senegalese soldiers and was
thrown into prison at the fort to await his trial by court-martial.
He died suddenly one night in May 1922, by his own hand it is said,
in the prison, while under the surveillance of the French, and he
was buried. But one chief who was at the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_99">[99]</span> funeral told me that he looked under the mat
which covered the alleged corpse and discovered that there was
nothing there. The story spread that Tegama escaped and fled to the
north, where he is still living. Perhaps it is better that this
story should obtain credence than any other. Instead of Tegama, the
French officer in charge of the post was court-martialled for the
suicide of the king, but acquitted. The whole episode is curious,
but the truth is perhaps rather unsavoury. It is another of the
fierce tragedies of the Sahara.</p>
<p>Before Tegama, Osman Mikitan and Brahim (Ibrahim Dan Sugi) were
Sultans. Mikitan was Sultan when the post was first established at
the wells of T’in Shaman, but they changed places several times in
the course of the intrigues which took place between the passage of
the Foureau-Lamy Expedition in 1899 and the occupation of Air in
1904. In Barth’s day Abd el Qader, son of the Sultan Bakiri
(Bekri), was on the throne. His tenure of office was as precarious
as that of his successors, for he had been Sultan on a previous
occasion before Barth reached Agades, only to be deposed in favour
of Hamed el Rufai (Ahmed Rufaiyi), whom he again succeeded; they
once more changed places some three years afterwards, Abd el Qader
having reigned in all about thirty-two years, Hamed some twelve.
The tenure of office of the Sultans of Agades during the last
century has been as precarious as it was in Leo’s time, for we read
in this authority<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that the Tuareg “will sometime expel
their king and choose another; so that he which pleaseth the
inhabitants of the desert best is sure to be king of Agades.” Bello
in his history says the same:<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> “whenever a prince
displeased them, they dethroned him and appointed a different
one.”</p>
<p>The installation of the Sultan with the customs that obtain is
in the nature of a ceremonial recognition, by the representatives
of the principal tribes of the Tuareg of Air,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_100">[100]</span> of his elevation to office. Taken in
connection with the traditional mode of his selection, it throws an
interesting light on relationships of the various groups of the
Tuareg in Air. Barth, who was in Agades on such an occasion, wrote:
“The ceremonial was gone through inside the <em>fada</em> (palace);
but this was the procedure. First of all Abd el Kader (Qader) was
conducted from his private apartments to the public hall: the
chiefs of the Itisan (Itesan) and Kel Geres who were in front
begged him to sit down upon the <em>gado</em>, a sort of couch or
divan, made of the leaves of the palm tree . . . similar to the
<em>angarib</em> used in Egypt and the lands of the Upper Nile, and
covered with mats and carpets. Upon this the Sultan sat down,
resting his feet on the ground, not being allowed to put them on
the <em>gado</em> and recline in the Oriental style until the Kel
Owi had desired him to do so.<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Such is the ceremony,
symbolical of the combined participation of these different tribes
in the investiture of their Sultan.”<a id=
"FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
The throne-room in the old palace seems to have been more imposing
than any part of the royal dwelling of to-day. The present audience
chamber is a low, arched room, with a small daïs or seat at one end
near a narrow stairway leading up to three rooms in an upper
storey, which is now not in use. These rooms are lighted by small
windows looking over the outer court. I wandered at random in and
out of the palace except that small part which is still used by
Omar himself and his women-folk. The deserted rooms were deep in
dust and fallen plaster. The courts were infested with dogs,
children and chickens. The palace was far less magnificent and
certainly less well kept than many other houses in the city. Even
the small house of the Añastafidet, with its mats and solitary
carpet of horrid colours on the floor of the guest-chamber, was
more cleanly.</p>
<p>The present Sultan enjoys little or no authority;
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> predecessors,
unless they were backed by the more important chiefs in Air, were
almost equally powerless, for the position of the Sultan, or
Amenokal, as he is called in Temajegh, is curious. It is said in
the native tradition that in the early days there was no authority
in the land other than that of the chiefs of the various groups of
tribes, and these did not in any way acknowledge one another’s
authority over affairs which interested the community at large. The
groups and single tribes were constantly at war with one another,
and there were then 70,000 people in the land, with no common
ruler.<a id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class=
"fnanchor">[88]</a> The more reasonable chiefs recognised that some
figure-head at least was necessary, but they could not agree that
he should be chosen from any of the principal groups of clans in
Air. They therefore sent a deputation to Istambul or Santambul
(Constantinople) to the Commander of the Faithful, asking him to
appoint a Prince to come and rule over them. The Khalif called
together the sons of his wives and offered them all the country
from the land of the Aulimmiden in the west to Sokoto in the east
(<em>sic</em>), and from Tadent in the north to the lands of the
Negroes in the south. But Air was so far away that none of the sons
of the Khalif was willing to leave the comforts of Stambul. The
Embassy was kept waiting for three years. Finally the Commander of
the Faithful, weakening before the tears of his legitimate wives,
the mothers of his sons, selected the child of a concubine to rule
over the Tuareg of the south. The candidate returned with the
deputation to Air and from that day to this there are said to have
been one hundred rulers in the land. This figure does not, of
course, represent the exact number; it is only meant figuratively
to indicate a long period of time.</p>
<p>From the original impressions I had received in Air I came to
the conclusion that the installation of the first Sultan could be
assigned to the beginning of the fifteenth century <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span>, or, in other words, to a period prior to the
capture of Constantinople by the Moslems. In the course of
some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> research on
the subject I discovered that 1420 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
had been suggested by one authority on the evidence of tradition,
while the Agades Chronicle, independently of all this evidence, had
recorded that the first Sultan, Yunis,<a id=
"FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
ascended the throne in 809 <span class="sc2">A.H.</span>, or about
1406 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The important thing in any
case is that, if the story of his choice has any historical
foundation whatsoever, it must be referred to a period when
Christian emperors were still ruling in Constantinople. It is
therefore all the more interesting to learn that the first Sultan
was called Yunis, which means John, and that the wife of the first
Sultan, a noble girl said to have been given to him in marriage by
the Kel Ferwan tribe, was called Ibuzahil or Izubahil, a name
bearing a curious resemblance to Isabel. It is a fitting name for
the companion of John, the man from the distant land.</p>
<p>If a deputation went to the Mediterranean at all, it was natural
at this period that it should go to Constantinople, still regarded
as the capital of nations, with which no other city in the
fifteenth century could compare for civilisation or splendour. But
we shall probably never know whether a Byzantine prince came to Air
in 1406 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> or whether the names and
legend of John and Isabel are only coincidence. Yunis is described
as the son of Tahanazeta, and I must leave for others to discover
Byzantine resemblances to this name. For the name of one of his
successors, Aliso, I suggest Louis may have been our equivalent,
and regarding the latter’s brother, Amati, who followed, comment is
hardly necessary.</p>
<p>Yunis reigned twenty years and was succeeded by Akasani,<a id=
"FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
who was the son of Yunis’s sister. Elsewhere El Haj
Ebesan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> or Abeshan,
a son of Yunis, and his son, El Haj Muhammad ben Ebesan, are said
to have reigned respectively as second and third Sultans, but this
is not substantiated by the Agades Chronicle, which mentions El Haj
Ebesan only as the grandfather of the sixteenth Sultan, Yusif, who
came to the throne about 1594. From this record there appear to
have been some forty rulers, several of whom reigned more than
once, but there are certain gaps in the series.<a id=
"FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class=
"fnanchor">[92]</a></p>
<p>After the very first ruler the reigning family divided into two
branches, which keep on reappearing, many of the Sultans of one
being deposed by powerful tribes like the Itesan in favour of
candidates of the other line. The family of El Guddala or Ghodala
figures prominently with several notable rulers like Muhammad
Hammad, who was known as the Father of his People. From such
records as are available I have tried to recover the genealogy of
this stock; but the Agades Chronicle is neither accurate nor
complete;<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class=
"fnanchor">[93]</a> although it is almost the only detailed
information which we possess for the present. One noteworthy fact
accords well with Ibn Batutah’s observations and with certain
matriarchal survivals which will be referred to in detail
hereafter: there are repeated instances of descent being traced
through the female line. Nevertheless, this was not an essential
condition. The ruler to this day is elected by the same tribes
originally responsible for the elevation of Yunis to the throne: he
must be drawn from one of the two branches of the original family,
and his heir, subject to due and proper election, is normally
considered to be his sister’s son.</p>
<p>Being the son of a concubine or slave, the king, according to
the rules of descent of all the Tuareg, was himself of slave caste,
nor could he ever achieve the distinction of being ranked among the
nobles. As it is the law among the People of the Veil that the
child must follow the caste of the mother and not the father,
whatever the latter’s claims, only the offspring of a noble Tuareg
woman can be noble. In all<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_104">[104]</span> other matrimonial combinations the child
must be a serf or slave. A slight distinction is sometimes drawn if
only the mother is inferior, but it has the effect, at the most, of
creating a mixed caste, without admitting the possibility of the
child becoming a noble. When the problem arose of finding a wife
for the first ruler who had been selected by the Khalif, despite
the pre-eminence of his sponsor, tradition prevailed, that he was
to be given a slave woman for wife. The arrangement had the
advantage of perpetuating the status of the original Amenokal,
since his children perforce had to continue in the inferior caste.
For political reasons certain exceptions seem to have been made,
and the Amenokal, though a serf, was also allowed to marry a noble
woman, but in that case her children were not eligible. The
marriage of John and Isabel—if she came from the noble Kel Ferwan,
and not from Constantinople, as I suspect—may be an instance of
such political dispensation. The restriction of the choice of the
Amenokal to one of the two branches of the original family, and the
force of tradition in regard to his descent, have resulted in the
apparent paradox that in order to be Sultan of Agades the candidate
has to be a slave. These considerations duly influenced the choice
of the present Amenokal, Omar.</p>
<p>Insignificant as his power nominally is, and unimportant as the
office may practically be, many of the traditional stories which
purport to explain the circumstances attending the Sultan’s
elevation to the throne are probably fanciful. They may be accepted
but still be fictions in the legal sense. Unless or until Byzantine
researches can come to our assistance, the logical explanation, if
there is one, must be sought. Shorn of romance, what appears most
likely to have happened is that the Tuareg of Air at a certain
stage were unable to reach any agreement regarding the selection of
a head of the State. They were divided up into groups which their
piecemeal immigration had accentuated. But the necessities of trade
and caravan traffic made it essential for the common weal to have
some sovereign or head, even if he were only a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_105">[105]</span> nominal ruler, to maintain foreign
relations and transact political business on behalf of the
inhabitants of Air generally with the Emirates and Empires of the
Sudan. Since none of the principal tribes was willing to forgo the
privilege of providing the ruler, the expedient was hit upon of
appointing a man whose status would never conflict with the
authority of the tribal chiefs within the borders of the country,
but who could still be delegated to speak for the whole community
with the rulers of the Southland. With all the jealousy that exists
among the tribes on the question of relative nobility or antiquity,
the only people fulfilling the essentials were of servile caste.
The choice of such a man was nevertheless possible among the
Tuareg, for neither “imghad” nor slaves are despised or regarded as
mere animals. This, I think, is the only explanation of the usage
which obtains, that whatever may be the caste of the Amenokal’s
children, only the servile ones are eligible. Although the family
of the Sultan may include noble persons, it is, as a whole, a
servile group in both its branches; it seems that Barth is mistaken
in regarding the group as noble. The family may, as he says, be
called “Sherrifa,” but probably only on account of its reputed
origin. It is not considered any the more noble in the Tuareg sense
of the word for all that.<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>This does not exclude the possibility of the Constantinople
Embassy being true, but the explanation I have given of the slave
kings of Air seems to be sufficient on its own merits and also
reasonable. Every factor in the situation points to the care which
was taken to eliminate all possible chances of dispute; even the
relegation of the choice to one servile family singled out for the
purpose would tend to diminish friction. On the whole the procedure
may be said to provide a rational if cynical solution of what has
always been a difficult problem in all countries.<a id=
"FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Inasmuch as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> the
explanation also serves to elucidate a number of other problems, it
may be said to receive confirmation.</p>
<p>Thus, the principal Minister or Vizir of the Amenokal is the
Sariki n’Turawa,<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> a Hausa term meaning the “Chief of the
White People.” The White People are the Arab traders from the
north, who themselves call this official the “Sheikh el Arab.” His
functions are those of Minister for Foreign Affairs:<a id=
"FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
his duties are to regulate the foreign community of Agades and
settle all questions of trade with the outside world. Though
originally appointed to deal with the Arabs of the north, he came
eventually to have more to do with the Southland. He used to
collect the duties on merchandise in Agades and accompany the salt
caravans to Bilma, a service for which he received an eighth part
of an average camel load of salt. After the salt caravan returned,
the Sariki n’Turawa proceeded south with the camels returning to
Sokoto, and then went on to Kano. The latter part of his journey
had already been discontinued in 1850, but he still accompanies the
salt caravan as the representative of the Sultan and nominal leader
of the enterprise. In addition to these duties involving foreign
relations, he is the Amenokal’s chief adviser and “Master of the
Interior of the Palace,” with the Songhai name of “Kokoi Geregeri.”
He is also known as the “Wakili” or Chief Agent of the king. The
reason for the Chief Minister in Agades being also Minister for
Foreign Affairs needs no further comment after what has been said
of the Sultan himself and his <em>raison d’être</em>.</p>
<p>Other officials and courtiers round the Amenokal include the
Sariki n’Kaswa, or Chief of the Market Place, who collects the
market dues and supervises the prices of commodities. There are,
besides, police officials or policemen who are also the
executioners, and a number of persons called after the class from
whom they are chosen, the “magadeza.”<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_107">[107]</span> The word seems to be a corruption of
“Emagadezi,” meaning People of Agades, but has acquired a more
restricted meaning, and is commonly applied to a number of rather
fat men who are reputed to be the posterity of the attendants of
the first Yunis who came from Constantinople.<a id=
"FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class=
"fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p>By virtue of his own position the Amenokal enjoys very little
authority. He is used as an arbitrator and Judge of Appeal. In
cases where the disputants are both from the same group of clans
their quarrel would normally be referred to the head of their
aggregation, except amongst the Kel Owi, over whom the Añastafidet
is the administrative authority, or court of the second instance;
in minor matters the tribal chief can, of course, decide on his own
initiative. But in disputes between persons of different tribes who
cannot agree on the finding of the chief of either of their
factions, the case may be referred to the Sultan, on whose behalf
the Kadhi renders judgment. Such functions as the Sultan performs
are executed with the consent of the governed. Although all serious
cases might be referred to him in theory, in practice his authority
has never run in local tribal affairs. He has a common gaol for
criminals, used in the first instance for those of the city, but
also for such as cannot be satisfactorily punished under the tribal
arrangements of a nomadic and semi-nomadic people. There were cases
when chiefs of tribes might be, and were, imprisoned at Agades, but
then it was because the power behind the throne had so desired it.
The Sultan apparently at one time also had a dungeon with swords
and spears fixed upright in the floor upon which criminal
malefactors were thrown; but already in 1850 it was rarely
used.</p>
<p>It cannot be too carefully emphasised that the rule of the
Sultan as the elected head of the State of Agades was founded upon
the consent of the governed. He is the figure-head of the community
and performs the same useful duties which so many heads of more
civilised States undertake. The Tuareg have probably never had
occasion to discuss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the social contract, and the works of J. S. Mill or Rousseau are
not current in Air, but nowhere are these theories of government
more meticulously carried into effect or do they assume the
practical form which they have often lacked in Europe. With all
their aristocratic traditions of caste and breeding, the Tuareg
have never favoured an established or hereditary autocracy. The
government they prefer seems to be a democratic monarchy. Their
king is a slave elected by the representatives of certain, at one
time doubtless the most important, tribes; he exists and carries
out certain functions because the mass of the people desire it so.
Authority is not inherited, and even men of inferior caste may
become chieftains. The evolution of society has also inevitably
rendered the king dependent for support upon the principal men of
the country, and the latter upon the smaller chieftains. Where
there is much rivalry or where the ruler is weaker than usual the
frequent changes and inconsistency inherent in democratic
government ensue. Equally the ascendancy of one man’s personality
independently of his position may override the voice of the people,
but in the absence of organisation or bureaucracy the conditioning
factor is efficiency and competence. Tribal leaders are selected
because they can lead; when they cease to lead they are
deposed.</p>
<p>The unenviable position of the king and his dependence on the
influence of the chiefs seem consequently to have been the same
throughout the ages. Leo<a id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> refers to the practice of
deposing one king and electing another from the same family who was
more acceptable. Bello on the subject has also already been quoted.
We have just seen how often and why Osman Mikitan and Brahim
changed places. Barth recounts how in his day Abd el Qader was
completely in the hands of the Kel Owi, who were represented by the
dominant personality of their paramount chief, Annur. His own tribe
was not even, as a matter of fact, among those responsible for the
selection of the Sultan, but<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_109">[109]</span> his personality was such that the Amenokal,
at his request, or with his support, felt himself strong enough to
imprison three turbulent chiefs of the Itesan who were stirring up
the people in Agades in favour of a pretender. Yet the Itesan, a
tribe of the southern Kel Geres, are the foremost of the tribes
responsible for the Sultan’s very election and his maintenance in
power. Without Annur’s support, Abd el Qader was powerless.</p>

<p class="cp1">OMAR: AMENOKAL OF AIR</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think that the persistence of tradition shows how essential
the method devised for choosing the head of the community was, and
is still considered to be among the Air Tuareg. Even to-day the
Itesan retain their predominant voice in the election, though they
live in the Sudan and are in part within the border of the country
administered by the British Government, and though their king is in
French territory hundreds of miles away. They were the deciding
factor in the election, after the death of Tegama,<a id=
"FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class=
"fnanchor">[100]</a> of Omar from the collateral branch which lives
with them.</p>
<p>Only in rare cases was the Amenokal a leader in war. Muhammad
Hammad is an instance in point, but it is clear he was an
exceptional man. When raids had taken place or were threatening in
such a manner as to affect the people of Air indiscriminately, or
where individual tribes might not consider themselves sufficiently
involved to occasion reprisals, the Sultan used to lead a
counter-raid recruited from several clans and provisioned according
to his direction from those groups most capable of supplying the
needs. In no case could a Sultan lead a raid against an Air tribe,
whether in the north or in the south, unless he had definitely
thrown in his lot with a local intrigue, which theoretically would,
and usually did, entail his eventual deposition. Within Air the
Sultan was neutral, or as we should say “constitutional.” He could
only take the field against people like the Aulimmiden of the west,
or the Tebu of the east, or the Ahaggaren<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> of the north beyond the borders of his
country. As a general rule, however, leading in war was the task of
tribal chieftains and not of the king.</p>
<p>The Amenokal does not seem to have had a fixed revenue. He lived
principally on the presents given to him by the tribes on the
occasion of his accession, and more especially by those tribes
which owe allegiance directly to himself. He was entitled to
collect a tax on foreign merchandise entering the city and a tithe
from certain servile tribes in the southern parts of Air.<a id=
"FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> In addition he had certain perquisites in the
shape of judicial fines imposed on individuals and tribes, and a
revenue from legitimate trading with Bilma during the great salt
caravans.</p>
<p>In considering the history of Agades one cannot fail to be
struck by the peculiarity of the site.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in North Africa, where any of the great caravan roads
pass through areas of fertility which break up the journeys into
sections, towns and cities, in some cases of considerable
magnitude, have grown up. Where these settlements are near the
margin of belts of permanent sedentary inhabitation, they play the
part of termini or ports for the trans-desert traffic. They have
become markets and the seats of the transport and produce brokers,
a development which has its parallels in Arabia and Central Asia.
There are many instances in Northern Africa of such terminal points
becoming large and important centres: some of the more active of
these “ports,” as they may be called, in the north are Sijilmasa,
Wargla, Ghadames, Tripoli, Orfella and Benghazi. Corresponding with
them at the southern end of the various roads are Timbuctoo, Gao,
Sokoto, Katsina and Kano.<a id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In addition to that
there are also the true Cities of the Desert. They have arisen in
places where caravans can call a halt to rest and replenish food
supplies, where water is plentiful, and sometimes also, where these
requisites are present, at the intersection of important routes.
These settlements are like island coaling stations in
maritime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
navigation, but they are not termini; they are particularly
interesting ethnologically, for they often mark the ends of stages
where the transport of merchandise changes hands. At these points
one tribe or race hands over its charge to another group of people.
They are thus entrepôts where goods are discharged and
reshipped—not markets, but broking centres where the transport
contractors and merchants who live at either end of the routes have
their agents. A money market often develops, but the local trade is
small, for it is confined to the requirements of the place and
immediate neighbourhood. At all costs, either by means of a strong
local government or by mutual consent, tribes which elsewhere may
be at war with one another must be compelled to meet in peace to
pursue their lawful occasions. The essentials for the growth of
such centres are invariably the presence of water, pasture and, to
a lesser extent, food. Where these factors can be obtained at one
definite point only, the centre is fixed, whereas if there are
several places all more or less equally convenient for the traffic,
the settlement has a tendency to move under the influence of
political changes. In Tuggurt, Laghuat and Ghat may be found
instances where the centre has been unable to shift on account of
geographical conditions; but in the Tuat-Tidikelt area the most
important town of In Salah has had many rivals, which have
prevented it acquiring the same compactness or prominence as, for
instance, the city of Ghat. At the latter place a large permanent
water supply in an arid country practically limited the choice of
sites to one spot. A commercial city of paramount importance, if of
no great size, sprang up in the earliest times and continued
uninfluenced by political vicissitudes. As an entrepôt of commerce
where there was peace at all times among the local population,
where feuds and racial hostility were set aside within its
precincts, where free trade was the oldest tradition and where an
efficient municipal organisation did not seek to extend its
influence far beyond the walls, Ghat developed a government similar
to that of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
autonomous Hanseatic town. Ghat is the most interesting of all the
cities of the desert, but the decline of caravan trade has brought
ruin to its people and war among the tribes, which no longer have
the material incentive of trade to refrain from fighting.</p>
<p>On the eastern of the two central roads across the Sahara there
is a stage where one would expect to find a town like Ghat, for to
the south on both these routes there is a tract of desert to be
crossed before reaching Kawar or Air respectively. But in the
Eastern Fezzan the choice of locality was not restricted by
geographical and economic considerations, and Murzuk, as the
counterpart in modern times of Ghat, has consequently not always
been the most important centre of the area. In early classical
times Garama, now known as Jerma, some sixty miles to the north of
Murzuk, was the capital of the Garamantian kingdom. When Jerma was
destroyed by the Arabs in the seventh century, Zuila, probably the
Cillala of the Romans, became the capital of the Eastern Fezzan,
maintaining its supremacy even after conquest by the Beni Khattab
in the tenth century. When in the fourteenth century the Fezzan was
overrun by the people of Kanem the capital again moved, this time
to Traghen.</p>
<p>Air is the next stage on the road to the Sudan after crossing
the desert to the south of Ghat. The requisites of water, pasture
and food are found all over this vast oasis; the principal
settlement might therefore be presumed to have changed its site
under the influence of politics, and in a great measure this has
happened, but the largest settlement in the country, the City of
Agades, is comparatively modern and appears to owe its existence to
political rather than to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Standing on the north side of the valley which is named after
it, Agades is in one sense a City of the Desert, since it lies on
the edge of a Saharan oasis. In so far as it is a true desert city
at all, it is the greatest of them, but, as we shall see, it has
not quite the same characteristics as its smaller<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> rivals. Ghat, before the war,
was said to number less than 4000 people, but may have attained
double this figure at one time; the population of Murzuk was
variously estimated at 2800 by Barth and at 6500 by Nachtigal;
Ghadames is believed to have a population of about 7000. But Agades
in the days of its prosperity must have contained not less than
30,000 inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> By 1850 the population had fallen to
about 7000; ten years ago the number was estimated at 10,000.
To-day there are not 3000 people in the half-ruined city, but the
numbers are again increasing since the efflux of population after
the 1917 revolution. These astonishing variations in population are
a normal feature of desert cities, even as they are of harbours and
seaport towns where the places are entirely dependent on conditions
of trade, which is affected by political change; in the Sahara the
mode of life of the surrounding nomads makes these fluctuations
even more conspicuous.</p>
<p>None of the considerations governing the site of other desert
cities applies to Agades. It lies on the southernmost foothills of
the Air mountains, and in the history of the country there has
never been any danger of invasion except from the south. Some of
the Tuareg, it is true, gradually penetrated Air from the north,
and pushed south by the progressive occupation of the northern
mountains, which the original population may not have been
sufficiently interested or numerous to occupy and defend. Small
raiding parties can always enter the country, but it is certain
that with even inconspicuous opposing forces the success of an
invading army approaching Air from any direction except the south
is out of the question, owing to the difficulties of moving large
bodies of men over the appalling desert which separates the plateau
from Ahaggar or the Fezzan. The same conditions obtain in the east,
and to a great extent in the west also. On the south only is the
position rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
different. The steppe desert between Air and Damergu is neither so
waterless nor so pastureless nor so deep as to preclude military
operations from that direction. In point of fact Air was invaded on
at least one occasion from that side with conspicuous
success.<a id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class=
"fnanchor">[104]</a> It is therefore anomalous that the capital of
the country should have been located on the fringe of the
mountains, where every road is defensible, in possibly the most
vulnerable position which could have been chosen.</p>
<p>Nor is the explanation to be found in such economic necessity as
has dictated the choice of site in other examples of desert cities.
Agades is some distance from the great north-south road which runs,
and always has run, east of the Central massif of Air, leaving the
country on its way to the Sudan at the water of Eghalgawen or
Tergulawen. An alternative route to the Sokoto area branching off
the main road in Northern Air and descending by the Talak plain and
In Gall passes some distance west of the city. No caravan road
suitable for heavily-laden camels passes through Agades for the
north, owing to the barrier of the Central massifs, through which
the tracks are difficult even for mountain-bred camels. The old
pilgrim road from Timbuctoo to Cairo enters the western side of the
Air plateau at In Gall or further north, and passes to Iferuan and
so to Ghat without touching Agades. Ibn Batutah’s route shows that
this was so in his day, as it certainly has been the case since
then. Caravans from the south crossing the Eastern Desert for Bilma
pass across Azawagh to the eastern fringes of Air without going to
Agades, which would involve a detour, as was explained in referring
to the importance of the well of Masalet.<a id=
"FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>While the trade
routes of the country do not, therefore, provide an adequate
justification for the choice of the site, climatic or geographic
conditions have equally little bearing, for there are a number of
points in Air where the pasture is good and where there is
sufficient water to supply the needs of a large settlement. At
Agades, as a matter of fact, the water is indifferent; while the
surrounding gravelly plain, like the rest of the valley, is only
covered with scanty vegetation, the neighbouring Telwa valley
contains some pastures, but they are not abundant, and camels in
the service of the local merchants have to be sent to feed as much
as three or four days distant.</p>
<p>If the conditions which had led to the growth of a city in Air
had been of a purely economic order, it might have been anticipated
that it would have occupied the site of Iferuan, the first point
south of Ghat where a permanent settlement with plentiful water,
pasture and land fit for cultivation was possible. So convenient is
the Iferuan valley that caravans, in fact, usually do rest there
for long periods to allow both men and animals to recuperate after
the difficult stage to the north has been negotiated. Or, again, a
city might have stood at the eastern end of the River of Agades at
the north end of the stage across the Azawagh, although this
position would have been less dictated by necessity than the first
alternative, since the steppe desert of the south cannot be
compared for hardship with the northern waste. It would
nevertheless have been convenient, if somewhat exposed to raiding
parties, as a point for the concentration of caravans crossing the
Eastern Desert to Bilma, or in other words at the branching of the
Salt Road and the north-south route. On its present site, Agades is
out of the way for travellers from any direction who may be bound
beyond the city. Some other explanation must then be found, and it
occurred to me only when I had reached the city itself.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Agades is not the capital of Air
at all. As we have seen, the city is not the seat of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> the central government because
there is no real central government, and the King who lives there
is not really King at all. Agades is only the seat of an
administration set up in the first instance to deal with exterior
affairs, and more especially those connected with the Southland.
These affairs were in the charge of a figure-head ruler
unconnected, except to a very minor degree, with the internal
problems of the Tuareg tribes. When this is once grasped, Agades
assumes a different position in the perspective of history and it
becomes apparent that the site is really suited to the purpose for
which it was intended. The place where the city lies is neutral as
far as the tribes of Air are concerned; it has easy access to the
Sudan yet is removed from the main roads, which are considered the
property of certain groups of clans. But it follows that the
character of the city must inevitably partake rather of the south
than of the Sahara.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the most conclusive evidence of all; during
the early part of the Tuareg occupation of Air, there was no city
of Agades at all; it fulfilled no need despite the caravan traffic.
It was presumably not founded when Ibn Batutah travelled through
Air, for he makes no mention of the name; although this is negative
evidence, it is valuable in the case of so observant a traveller.
By 1515, when Askia conquered the Tuareg of Air, Agades, however,
was certainly in existence, since it is on record that he occupied
the city for a year, “sitting down north of the town,” possibly at
T’in Shaman. Marmol, moreover, is quite definite on the subject,
saying that the city was founded 160 years before he wrote, a date
which has been reckoned at 1460 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span><a id=
"FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a> We know that the first Sultans of Air did not
live at Agades, but by inference it may be supposed that they soon
came to do so, so that the date suggested is probably correct. With
the advent of a figure-head king there sprang up a figure-head
capital. The story of Agades is the story of its kings: the
explanation of both is similar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>What seems to
have struck Barth most about Agades was that the people spoke
Songhai and not Temajegh; it was, in fact, one of the few places
left where the language of the greatest Empire of the Niger still
survived. There is reason to believe that most of the Emagadezi are
not of Tuareg race at all. The Songhai element is probably
preponderant even now, four hundred years after the conquest of
Agades by the Songhai king, Muhammad Askia, who planted a colony
there. The face veil has been adopted universally, but the physical
type of the inhabitants is much more akin to that of people of the
south than to that of true Tuareg. The descendants of the Songhai
conquerors are coarse, broad-featured people with dark skins and
untidy hair, which is an abomination among the noble Tuareg. The
same characteristics reappear among the inhabitants of certain
points west of Agades on the south-western outskirts of Air, where
the Songhai element is also known to have become established and to
have survived. The people of Agades are hardly even considered as
natives of the country by the rest of the inhabitants of Air. They
are not classed as a group, like the inhabitants of other
settlements in the mountains. It is rarer to hear the “Kel Agades”
mentioned than it is to hear such exotic compositions as “Kel es
Sudan” or “Kel Katchena.” The people of Agades are more usually
spoken of as the “Emagadezi,” in much the same way as the Kanuri in
the Air dialect are called “Izghan” and the Tebu “Ikaradan.”</p>
<p>The family of the Sultan is foreign in appearance. The
physiognomy of Abd el Qader, who wore the white face veil usually
associated in the north with servile caste, was not, as far as
could be seen by Barth, that of a Tuareg. His corpulence was
equally a foreign peculiarity, despite which Barth considered him
“a man of great worth though devoid of energy.” The personality of
the present Sultan, Omar, has already been described; his dark skin
and coarse features betray a very mixed ancestry. These
peculiarities are not unexpected in a family descended through
slave women, who may, of course, be of any race.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The different
races and languages of Agades would be interesting to study in
greater detail. The name Terjeman, given to one quarter of the
town, is evidence in the estimation of its inhabitants of the Babel
which has occurred. Temajegh, Hausa, Kanuri, Songhai and Arabic are
spoken; even the more exceptional Fulani, Wolof and Tebu are heard,
while the advent of the French garrison with its negro troops has
introduced further linguistic complications, and will, of course,
in time accentuate the Sudanese element in the racial composition,
for at no time do the morals of the ladies of Agades appear to have
been beyond reproach. The consequences of city life are felt even
here in the Sahara. The forwardness of the ladies so moved Barth to
indignation that he discoursed at considerable length on the
standards of conduct which should be observed by Europeans in these
far countries towards native women. He no doubt owed much of his
success to the respect in which he held the feelings of the people
among whom he travelled. Rather than provoke criticism, he
recommends explorers to take their own wives with them. A few pages
further on, describing his journey through the Azawagh, he is again
referring to advances of the Tuareg women of the Tegama. One
appreciates his resentment at these importunities, but is inclined
to speculate on the true inwardness of his thoughts. On one
occasion at least his artistic feelings rather than his sense of
propriety seem to have been offended, for he writes: “It could
scarcely be taken as a joke. Some of the women were immensely fat,
particularly in the hinder regions, for which the Tawarek have a
peculiar and expressive name—‘tebulloden.’”</p>

<p><span class="sc">On</span> 6th August, soon after noon, I
marched out of Agades with twenty-six camels and eight men for
Central Air. My two travelling companions had left the same morning
with ten camels in the opposite direction, bound for a point called
Tanut<a id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a> near Marandet in the cliff of the River of
Agades. Some men of the Kel Ferwan, who were camped under the cliff
south of the river, had brought information concerning a lion. At
Marandet, it appeared, a cow had been killed and the trail of the
offending beast was plainly visible; notwithstanding, Buchanan was
unable to secure this lion or any specimen, or even a skull, so it
proved impossible to classify the animal.</p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence goes to show that the lion still exists
in Air, but is nevertheless very rare. In the Tagharit valley, a
few miles north of Auderas, there is a cave in the side of a gorge
which a large stream has cut through a formation of columnar
basalt: a pink granite shelf makes a fine waterfall in the rainy
season with a pool which survives at its foot all the year round. A
lion used to live in this den until recent years, when it was
killed by the men of Auderas because it had pulled down a camel out
of a herd grazing in the neighbourhood. The carcase had been
dragged over boulders and through scrub and up the side of the
ravine into the lair; a feat of strength which no other animal but
a lion could possibly have accomplished. When I came to the
overhanging rock the ground was fœtid and befouled, and the
skeleton of the camel was still<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_120">[120]</span> there and comparatively fresh. One of the
men of Auderas who had been present at the killing secured a claw
as a valuable charm; another had apparently been severely mauled in
the shoulder. They had surrounded the “king of beasts,” as the
Tuareg also call him, and had attacked with spears and swords.
There was no doubt of the animal having been a lion.</p>
<p>The cave in the Tagharit gorge is a short distance from the
point<a id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a> where Barth<a id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> saw “numerous footprints
of the lion,” which he conceived to be extremely common in these
highlands in 1850, albeit “not very ferocious.” In 1905 a lioness
trying to find water fell into the well at Tagedufat and was
drowned; her two small cubs were brought into Agades, and one of
them was afterwards sent to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.<a id=
"FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class=
"fnanchor">[110]</a> This lion, however, may not have been of the
same variety as the Air species, for the latter is said never to
have been scientifically examined.</p>
<p>The Air lion has been described as a small maneless animal like
the Atlas species, though von Bary, who, however, never himself saw
one, heard that it had a mane. He confirms the report that the
animal was common, as late as in 1877, especially in the Bagezan
massif, where it used to attack camels and donkeys.<a id=
"FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a></p>
<p>The advent of the rains during the latter part of July made
travelling through Air in many ways very pleasant. But there were
also disadvantages. With the first fall of rain the flies and
mosquitoes came into their own again. The common house-flies were
especially trying during my journey north of Agades. They infested
the country miles from any human habitation or open water.</p>

<p>South of Agades the rains proved a terrible burden. The combined
onslaughts of flies, mosquitoes and every other form of winged and
crawling insect made life intolerable for Buchanan’s party; meals
had to be eaten under<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_121">[121]</span> netting and naked lights were rapidly
extinguished by incinerated corpses. Camels got no rest. Even the
hardened natives had recourse to any device to snatch a little
sleep. They went so far as to make their beds in the thorny arms of
small acacia trees in order to escape the plague. The alluvial
plain of the River of Agades had become so soft as to be almost
impossible to cross. Mud engulfed the camels up to their bellies.
The drivers used to unload them and push them bodily over on to
their sides at the risk of breaking their legs in order to let the
brutes kick themselves free. The several stream beds of the system,
even if not too swollen to be completely unfordable, had such
perpendicular banks where the water had cut its way down several
feet below the surface of the ground that they became formidable
obstacles. The constant threat of rain made long marches
impossible, though it was abundantly clear that the longer the time
that was spent in the valley the worse the ground would become.
Buchanan was rewarded for his disappointment at not finding a lion
by securing near Tanut two fine specimens of ostrich and an
ant-bear. He also reported the existence near Marandet of a
cemetery in the bank of a stream bed. It was unfortunate that he
had not time to examine this site, as it seems to be an example of
urn burial, probably of pre-Tuareg date.<a id=
"FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
<p>Half a day’s march from Agades brought me to the village of
Azzal on the valley of the same name, the lower part of which is
called “Telwa,” the most convenient name for the whole of this
important basin. Azzal and the neighbouring Alarsas<a id=
"FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a> are small settlements with a few date palms
and some gardens. They were formerly inhabited only by serfs
engaged in cultivating the gardens which supply Agades with
vegetables. After the 1917 revolution in Air the noble population
of certain villages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
in the Ighazar, which was evacuated, settled there temporarily
under their chief, Abdulkerim of T’intaghoda. They were living in
straw and reed huts, hoping in the course of time to return north
and resume possession of the more substantial houses in their own
country. During my stay in Air several families did, as a matter of
fact, go back to Iferuan and Seliufet. But the presence of the
remainder of these Kel Ighazar in the south is somewhat anomalous,
as the country from the earliest times has been almost exclusively
inhabited by servile people. The area, extending over the foothills
of the main plateau, is not yet, properly speaking, Air, in the
sense in which the name is used by the Tuareg. Like the desert
further south, it is called Tegama.</p>
<p>After following the Telwa for a short distance the track crosses
to the left bank and winds over low bare hills and torrent beds. A
little before reaching Solom Solom there is a wooded valley which
the road leaves to cross a stretch of higher ground by a small pass
covered with the remains of stone dwellings, the site, I presumed,
of Ir n’Allem. The track is evidently very old at this point, for
in places it has worn deep into the rock. The country is wild and
picturesque, but the earth-brown hills are fashioned on a small
scale. The district used to be infested by brigands who preyed on
the caravans bound to and from Agades.</p>
<p>The southern part of my journey followed the usual route, though
Barth on his expedition from T’intellust to Agades travelled both
there and back by an alternative track rather further east in the
Boghel valley and via Tanut Unghaidan, which is not far from Azzal,
where he rejoined the more habitual way.</p>
<p>At Dabaga my road from Solom Solom rejoined the Telwa valley and
crossed the stream bed after a short descent into a basin covered
with dense thickets of dûm palms and acacias. The trees were filled
with birds. The river was in full flood, over a quarter of a mile
wide and some two feet deep—an imposing stream draining
south-western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Bagezan and Todra into the River of Agades. I was luckily able to
cross it with my laden camels, but some travellers only a little
behind me were held up for several days by the floods which
followed the heavy rain in Central Air. Travelling at this season
of the year is slow, as camp must be pitched before the daily rains
begin, usually soon after noon. On the other hand, it is very
convenient to be able to halt anywhere on the road regardless of
permanent watering-points; for every stream bed, even if not
actually in flood, contains pools or water in the sand.</p>
<p>Climatically Air is a Central African country. It is wholly
within the summer rainfall belt, the northern limit of which
coincides fairly accurately with the geographical boundary of the
country at the wells of In Azawa. The rains usually commence in
July, and last for two months, finishing as abruptly as they have
begun. Within the limits of the belt, the further north, the later,
on the whole, is the wet season, though great irregularities are
observed. In Nigeria the rains fall during May and June, at Iferuan
they occur in August and September.<a id=
"FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a> They are tropical in their intensity, and in
Air nearly always fall between noon and sunset.</p>
<p>During my stay at Auderas there were a few days when the sky was
overcast for the whole of the twenty-four hours, with little
rainfall; the damp heavy feeling in the air reminded one of
England, as the atmosphere was cold and misty. On one particular
day it rained lightly and fitfully for fourteen hours on end with
occasional heavy showers. Such phenomena, however, are rare.
Precipitation follows a north-easterly wind and usually lasts three
or four hours; as soon as the westerly wind, prevalent at this
season, has sprung up, the nimbus disperses rapidly, leaving only
enough clouds in the evening to produce the most magnificent
sunsets that I have ever seen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>In 1922 the
rainy season at Auderas was virtually over by the 10th September,
though it continued a little later in the north. The rains were
followed by a period of damp heat, and then by some days when the
ground haze was so thick that visibility was limited to a few
hundred yards. Until recent years there seems to have been a short
second rainy season in the north of Air coinciding with the first
part of the Mediterranean winter precipitation. In November near
Iferuan I experienced several days on which rain appeared to be
imminent, but none fell. Natives told me that up to three or four
years previously they had often had a few days’ rain in December
and January. In 1850 the last rain of the summer season, which,
exceptionally, had begun as far north and as early as 26th May at
Murzuk, was recorded on 7th October, but in November and December
after a fine period the sky had again become overcast, and a few
drops of rain actually fell in Damergu on 7th January, 1851. The
cycles of precipitation in the Sahara are constantly varying and
data are as yet insufficient to permit any conclusion. It would be
quite incorrect, from the accounts of the last ten years alone, to
suppose that the rainfall had markedly diminished, or that the
second rainy season had disappeared.</p>
<p>During the rains the larger watercourses meandering among the
massifs of the country often become impassable for days on end,
which is inconvenient, for in ordinary times they are the channels
of communication. Owing to the lack of surface soil and vegetation
on the as yet undisintegrated volcanic rock, streams fill with
surprising rapidity during the rains and are very dangerous for the
unwary traveller. The great joy of these weeks was the freshness of
the air after the intolerable heat of June and July, especially in
the plains. With the rain too came the annual rebirth of plant
life, which made one’s outlook very sweet. In European spring-time
Nature awakes from winter sleep, but in Africa a new world, fresh
and green and luxurious, is born after the rains out of a
shrivelled corpse of sun-dried desert.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>At Dabaga I was
persuaded to forsake the caravan road which continues up the Telwa
and take a riding road by Assa Pool and the T’inien mountains.
Difficulties began at Assa, when I tried to pitch my tent on rocky
ground, with the result that it was almost impossible to keep it
erect in the rain squalls which followed. The evening, after the
rain, was unsatisfactory. I wounded two jackals at which I had
shot, but did not kill either. I missed several guinea-fowl and
only secured a pair of pigeons among the dûm palms of the valley.
Also, there were many flies. However, I made the acquaintance of
one of the greatest guides in Air, Efale, who overtook me on his
way north, and camped near me. He talked volubly that night. Next
day, after dropping sharply into the T’inien valley by a narrow
defile, the road became frankly devilish. At the bottom of the
steep sides the soil is impregnated with salt, which effectually
prevents anything growing. There are a number of circular pits
where the sandy salt, called “ara” or “agha,” is worked. The
mixture is dried in cakes and sold in the south for a few pence. It
is only fit for camels, which require a certain amount of salt
every month, more especially after they have been feeding on fresh
grass. “Ara” can only be used for human food if the sand has been
washed out and the brine re-dried.</p>
<p>After leaving Assa the vegetation had almost entirely
disappeared. Low gravel-strewn hills on the right obscured the view
to the east. The T’inien valley soon made a right-angle turn to the
north, closing to a narrow cleft, which became even rougher. The
track was a series of steps between huge granite and quartz
boulders, among which the camels kept on stumbling. Their loads
required constant readjustment and there was no room to kneel them
down. The way was really only fit for unloaded camels or riders on
urgent business. There had not been a tree or bush for hours. We
climbed some 600 feet in about a mile, almost to the very top of
the jagged peaks on the left that marked the summit of the T’inien
range. By 11.15 a.m. I was beginning to despair of finding a
camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> site before
the rain was due, as I foresaw a similar unpleasant descent on the
other side of the col which had so long been looming ahead. Then as
I reached the gates of the pass a view over the whole of Central
Air suddenly burst upon me in such beauty as I can never
forget.</p>
<p>The ground sloped imperceptibly to the east. It fell away only
about a hundred feet to the north, where a row of small crags, the
continuation of the T’inien range, cut off the western horizon.
Straight in front in the distance, piled mass upon mass, the blue
mountains of Central Air rose suddenly out of the uplands, soaring
into the African sky. Between the bold cliffs and peaks of the
Bagezan mountains and the long low Taruaji group to the right, a
few little conical hills of black rock broke the surface of the
vast plain which rolled away to the east. From so great a distance
the plain seemed tolerably smooth, veined like the hand of a man
with watercourses winding southwards from the foot of the
mountains. Black basalt boulders covered the flat spaces between
lines of green vegetation and the threads of white sand, where the
stream beds were just visible. Over the whole plain the new-born
grass was like the bloom on a freshly-picked fruit. To the
south-east stood the blue range of Taruaji itself, flat-topped and
low on the horizon. Either side of the hills the curve of the world
fell gently away towards the Nile.</p>
<p>I camped a mile or so north of the pass in a valley below the
precipitous cliffs of a rock called Okluf, which has a castellated
crown several hundred feet high. The rocks shone blue-black, with
their feet in a carpet of green that seemed too vivid to be real.
There were plenty of guinea-fowl and many other birds in the palm
woods and thorn groves, and such grass as I thought only grew in
the water meadows of England. I shall never forget the beauty of
Central Air on that noonday in the rains, though I have it in me to
regret the fiendish temper in which the day’s march had left me.
The flies in the evening and the fast-running things upon the
ground at night only made it worse. I had hurriedly and laboriously
pitched a tent, and it never rained after all.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>On the following
day I ascended the T’ilisdak valley which flows into the Telwa, and
reached Auderas village, where some huts had been prepared for us
by the chief Ahodu, a man who soon became my most particular
friend. The T’ilisdak valley is renowned for its excellent grazing
and for some mineral springs where men, camels and herds go after
the rainy season to take a “cure” of the waters.<a id=
"FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class=
"fnanchor">[115]</a> Near Okluf there are the remains of several
hut villages, and some with stone foundations of a more permanent
character. They belong to a servile tribe of Southern Air called
the Kel Nugguru, who at present are living somewhat further
west.</p>
<p>Air proper may be said to begin at the head of the T’ilisdak
valley. The part of the plateau I had traversed was therefore still
in Tegama, which includes the whole area south of Bagezan and Todra
as far as the River of Agades, as well as the Taruaji massif, but
not the country east of the latter and of Bagezan. Most of the
villages in Tegama have gardens, and some have groves of date
palms. That they are inhabited by serfs is, of course, natural,
since the cultivation of the soil, in the estimation of the noble
Tuareg, is not a worthy occupation for a man. When, however, in a
nomad society agriculture is relegated to an inferior caste of
people, it is inevitable that the practice should undermine the
older allegiances. It becomes possible for the settled and
therefore originally the servile people to accumulate wealth even
in bad times when the profit from raiding or caravaning is denied
to the upper classes of Air. The social effects of the disruption
caused by the 1917 revolution may be observed in the village
organisations, where people of different tribes are now tending
more and more to live in association under the rule of a village
headman, who for them is displacing the authority of their own
tribal chiefs. The village headmen,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_128">[128]</span> it is true, are sometimes themselves the
leaders of the tribes in whose area the village is situated, but
more often they are merely local men acting on the delegated
authority of the tribal chief, who in Tegama is probably the head
of an Imghad or servile tribe dependent in turn upon some noble
tribe living in a different part of Air. But in time the population
of a village may become known collectively as the people of such
and such a place, and so reference to the old tribal allegiance of
the inhabitants disappears.</p>
<p>Tuareg tribal names deserve close investigation. They are of two
categories: those which begin with “Kel” (People of . . .) and
those which begin with “I” or sometimes “A.” This “I” or “A” may be
quite strongly pronounced, but often represents the so-called
“neutral vowel,”<a id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a> which is very difficult to
transliterate. Thus the word “Ahaggar” might as correctly be
written “Ihaggar”; the initial vowel indeed is so little emphasised
that the French have come to write simply “Hoggar” or “Haggar.” On
the other hand, in the name Ikazkazan, an Air tribe, the “I” is
marked; in the Azger tribe, again, the Ihadanaren, it is so lightly
accentuated that Barth writes “Hadanarang.” This point, however, is
of little moment: what matters is the question of the type of
prefix to the name. To simplify reference I propose to call these
two types “Kel name” and “I name” tribes. After examining the two
categories at length, a distinction seemed to me to stand out
clearly; I believe it holds good among other Tuareg as well as
those of Air. The primary tribal divisions have names of the “I”
category, except in certain cases where they are nearly always
known to have been forgotten; the subdivisions of these tribes have
“Kel names.” The former are proper names; the latter are derived
either from the place where the people usually or once lived, or
from some inherent peculiarity. The word “Kel” is also used to
cover generalisations of no ethnic importance: the “I name,” on the
other hand, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
scarcely ever geographical or adjectival. The generalisation will
be clearer for a few examples, chosen among the Air tribes. The
noble tribe called Imasrodang has for sub-tribes the Kel Elar, Kel
Seliufet and Kel T’intaghoda, called after the villages where they
lived in Northern Air. Again, the Ikazkazan have one section or
group of sub-tribes called the Kel Ulli—the People of the Goats—who
are themselves subdivided into other factions bearing “Kel
names.”</p>
<p>Certain other “Kel names” like Kel Ataram or Kel Innek are often
heard in Air, but are not proper names at all; they were
erroneously regarded by Barth as tribal names, but simply mean the
“People of the West” and the “People of the East” respectively, and
have no inherent ethnic significance. In Air the former term
logically includes, and is meant to include, the Arab as well as
the Tuareg tribes of the west.<a id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
<p>So clear is this use of geographical “Kel names” that we shall
find repeated instances later on of tribes who, having migrated
from a certain area, retain their old names, though these are no
longer applicable to their new ranges. Take, for example, the Kel
Ferwan—the People of Iferuan, in North Air; they now live in the
southern parts of the country. Or, again, there are two Kel
Baghzen, called after a mountain group in Central Air; the one
group is still in that area, the other, which once lived there, has
since migrated to the country north of Sokoto.</p>
<p>In certain forms the word “Kel” corresponds to the Arabic word
“ahel,” but the latter seems more usually employed in connection
with wide geographical indications of habitat, without much ethnic
significance, like Kel Innek. The use of this type of “Kel name” is
the exception rather than the rule in Temajegh and has a colloquial
rather than traditional sanction. The more common “Kel names,” on
the other hand, are definitely individual tribal<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> names, and refer to small
areas. They are not by any means restricted to sedentary
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a></p>
<p>A third category of names commencing with the “Im” or “Em”
prefix is regarded by Barth<a id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> as virtually identical
with the “Kel” class, but this is not quite accurate. The “Im”
prefix is used to make an adjectival word form of place names; the
“Kel names” only become adjectival by prefixing “People of . . .”
Thus “Emagadezi” would be more correctly translated as “Agadesian”
than as the “People of Agades,” whose correct designation is Kel
Agades. “I names” partake of neither of these characteristics. For
the most part their significance remains unexplained. It follows
that “Kel names,” although proper to the tribes that bear them,
being descriptive or geographical, are certainly not so old as the
individual and proper “I names.”</p>
<p>There are examples of tribes which have lost their “I names” and
are only referred to by a “Kel name,” though in many cases this is
more apparent than real. When a tribe with an “I name” increases
until the point is reached where it subdivides, one of the
subdivisions retains the original “I name,” the remainder take
other and, usually, geographical appellations. This process might
be shown graphically:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>This difference
of nomenclature has a definite bearing on the difficulties of
co-ordinating sedentarism and nomadism in one people, which must
have occurred to everyone who has studied the problem in
administration. The exact relations between a village headman, the
tribal chiefs of the persons who are living in his village and the
tribal chief of the area in which the village is situated cannot be
defined. One set of allegiances is breaking down and another has
not yet been completely formed. This was already going on in Air
when the position was complicated by the advent of a European Power
demanding a cut-and-dried devolution of authority, and tending to
encourage sedentary qualities in order to prevent raiding. These
problems in Air to-day are almost insoluble, but they are of an
administrative rather than of an anthropological order.</p>
<p>Auderas at the present time is probably the most important place
in Air after Agades. As an essentially agricultural settlement it
is an excellent example of the village organisation. The valley of
Auderas lies about 2600 feet above the sea. Seven small valleys
unite above the village and two affluents come in below, draining
the western slopes of Mount Todra and a part of the Dogam group.
The main stream eventually finds its way out into the Talak
plain<a id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a> under various names. The sandy bed of the
valley near the village contains water all the year round. Both
banks are covered with intense vegetation, including a date-palm
plantation of some thousand trees. Under the date palms and amongst
the branching dûm-palm woods, where the thickets and small trees
have been cleared or burnt off, are a number of irrigated gardens
supplied with water from shallow wells. Some wheat, millet, guinea
corn and vegetables are grown with much labour and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> devotion. Onions and tomatoes
are the principal vegetables all the year round, with two sorts of
beans in the winter. Occasionally sweet potatoes and some European
vegetables like carrots, turnips and spinach are grown from seeds
which have been supplied by the French. Pumpkins do well and water
melons are common. There is also a sweet melon. Three different
shapes of gourds for making drinking and household vessels are
cultivated. Cotton is found in small quantities, the plant having
probably been imported from the Sudan. Its presence in Air is
interesting, as in 1850 Barth had placed the northern limit of
Sudan cotton in the south of Damergu. The cotton plant does very
well when carefully irrigated and produces a good quality of fibre.
Two samples which I brought home from Air were reported on
respectively as: “good colour, strong, fairly fine 1³⁄₁₆ staple,”
and “generally good colour, staple 1³⁄₁₆-1¼ inches, strong and
fine”; the materials were respectively valued at 20·35 and 21·35
pence per pound when American May Future Cotton stood at 17·35
pence (May 1924).<a id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121"
class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The Tuareg spin their cotton into a
rough yarn for sewing or making cord, but in Air they do not seem
to weave. The indigo plant grows wild in Air: it is not cultivated,
nor is it used locally for dyeing.</p>
<p>The gardens require much attention and preparation. The ground
is cleared and the scrub burnt off as a top dressing. The soil is
then carefully levelled by dragging a heavy plank or beam forwards
and backwards by hand across the surface. The area is divided up
into small patches about six feet square with a channel along one
side communicating with a leat from an irrigation well. These wells
are usually unlined and shallow, with a wooden platform overhanging
the water on one side; on this a rectangular frame is set up with a
second cross member carrying a pulley over which a rope is passed.
An ox or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> a donkey
pulls up the big leather bucket by the simple process of walking
away from the well, returning on its tracks to lower it again. The
bucket is a tubular contrivance, the bottom of which is folded up
while the water is raised; when it reaches the level of the
irrigation channel, a cord is pulled to open the bottom of the
leather tube and the water allowed to run out. The other end of
this cord is attached to the animal, and the length is so adjusted
that the operation is performed automatically each time the bucket
comes to the top. The pole and bucket with a counterweight and the
water wheel are not known in Air for raising water; nor are any
dams constructed either to make reservoirs in ravines or to
maintain a head of water for flow irrigation in the rainy season.
Each little patch in the gardens is hoed and dressed with animal
manure. The seed is planted and carefully tended every day, for it
is very valuable. Barth records seeing at Auderas a plough drawn by
slaves. This was clearly an importation from the north; the plough
is not now used anywhere in the country, which at heart has never
been agricultural.</p>

<p>As in the south, millet and guinea corn are sown during the
rains, but they usually require irrigation before they reach
maturity. In certain areas rain-grown crops could be raised most
years. In the past a fair amount of cereals seems to have been
produced in this way; to-day the Tuareg are too poor to risk losing
their seed in the event of inadequate or irregular rainfall.
Although the wheat grown in the Ighazar used nearly all to be
exported to the Fezzan, where it was much in demand on account of
its excellent quality for making the Arab food “kus-kus,” Air at no
time has produced enough grain for its own consumption. In the
economics of Air necessary grain imports are paid for by the
proceeds of wheat sales or live-stock traffic with the north, and
by the profits of the trade in salt from Bilma; these provide the
means of purchasing the cheaper millet and guinea corn of Damergu.
Any additional surplus, representing annual savings, is
invested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> in
live-stock, especially camels, within the borders of the
country.</p>
<p>The breakdown of the social organisations of the Tuareg in Air
compelled numbers of nobles out of sheer poverty after they had
lost their camels and herds to cultivate the soil; before the war
not even the servile people were very extensively so employed if
they could find enough slaves to do the work.</p>
<p>Neither the advent of a European Power nor the subsequent
changes in the social structure of the country has had very much
effect on the position of slaves in Air. Of these there are two
categories,<a id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> the household slave and the outdoor slave, and
both of them are chattels in local customary law. The former are
called “ikelan,” the latter “irawellan,”<a id=
"FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a> or alternatively “bela,” “buzu” or “bugadie,”
which, however, are not Temajegh words, but have been borrowed from
the south. The term “irawel” is also used generically to cover both
categories of slaves, although it primarily refers to the latter.
In the use of this word Barth<a id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> makes one of the few
mistakes of which he has been guilty, where he states that the most
noble part of the Kel Owi group of tribes in Air is the “Irolangh”
clan, to which the Amenokal or Sultan of the Kel Owi belonged. The
paramount chief of his day, Annur, belonged to the Kel Assarara
section of the Imaslagha tribe, which is probably the original and
certainly one of the most noble of the Kel Owi, for it includes the
Kel Tafidet, who gave their name to the whole confederation. The
traveller’s mistaken reference to Irawellan or Irolangh
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> probably due to
his having been informed by a member of some non-Kel Owi tribe that
Annur and all his people were “really Irawellan,” or servile
people. Such abuse of the Kel Owi is common among the other Air
Tuareg. It is certainly not justified in fact, and is due to the
contempt in which an older nobility will always hold more recent
arrivals.<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
<p>The negro slaves, the Ikelan, are primarily concerned with
garden cultivation, and are consequently sedentary. One half of the
produce of their labour goes to their masters and the other half to
support themselves and their families. Ikelan also perform all the
domestic duties of the Tuareg to whom they belong, and herd their
masters’ goats and sheep if they happen to be living in the same
neighbourhood. A certain proportion of the offspring of the flocks
is also given to the slaves. Since, primarily, they are cultivators
of the ground, they do not move from place to place with their
owners. They consequently often escape domestic work and herding.
Despite their legal status they are in practice permitted to own
property, though, if their masters decided to remove it, they would
be within their rights to do so. In other words, the theoretical
status of slavery which makes it impossible for a chattel to own
property has been considerably modified, and not as a consequence
of the altered conditions, or of the legislation of a European
Power, but because slavery among the Tuareg never did involve great
hardship. Their slaves, furthermore, always had the hope of
manumission and consequent change to the status of Imghad or serfs,
a rise in the social scale which, in fact, often did occur. It was
in slave trading and not in slave owning that the Tuareg sinned
against the ethical standards which are usually accepted in Europe,
and obtained so unenviable a reputation last century.</p>
<p>Herding live-stock, and especially camels, is the primary
function of the outdoor slave or Buzu. Though often also a negro,
he is considered to possess a somewhat higher<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_136">[136]</span> status than the Akel, for he does not as
a rule work in the house or village. The Buzu’s work, if on the
whole less strenuous than that of the tiller of gardens, is felt to
be more manly because he is associated with camels. He travels with
nobles or Imghad, to either of whom he may belong. He does all the
hard menial work on the march. He is responsible especially for
herding the camels at pasture and for loading and unloading them
each day on the road. Such duties as filling water-skins, driving
camels down to water, feeding them on the march and making rope for
the loads, all fall to his lot. The Buzu may even accompany his
master’s camels on raids or act as personal messenger for his lord.
When the camels are resting he spends his days watching the grazing
animals, or looking after any other herds which his master may own
in the neighbourhood. On the whole I have found the Buzu a
remarkably hard-working person. He is almost useless without his
master to give him orders and to see that they are carried out, but
ready to undertake any exertion connected with his work, which he
regards as his fate, but not his privilege to perform without
complaint.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine whether there is any racial
difference between the Buzu class, the tillers of gardens, and the
ordinary household slaves. The first are more respected than the
last, which may mean that they are more closely related in blood to
their masters. The practice of concubinage, though not very
widespread, has probably created the caste, and from them, in time,
a certain proportion of the Imghad. While theoretically the
children of a slave concubine and a Tuareg man ought to be “ikelan”
like their mother, in practice they tend to rise into the superior
caste of the Buzu, and eventually in successive generations to
Imghad. In Air at least the general tendency is for the
old-established caste distinctions to become more elastic and for
the ancient order to pass away. Although the events of the last
twenty years have contributed greatly to this change, the strongest
factor has certainly been the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_137">[137]</span> increasing wealth of the Imghad, but
another reason is probably that many Imghad tribes in Air were
themselves originally Imajeghan before their capture in war or
their subjugation by some means. Consequently with the dissolution
of tribal allegiances in Air and enhanced prosperity they have
tended to revert to their former status. They cling so tenaciously
to nobility of birth that, rather than accept the logical results
of inferiority consequent upon defeat in war, the people
collectively combine to admit the fiction of servile people
possessing dual status.</p>
<p>The presence of more than one racial type among the Imghad has
led certain travellers to make quite unjustifiable generalisations
about this section of Tuareg society. There have also been advanced
numerous and most unnecessarily complicated theories to account for
the division of the race as a whole into these two castes. The
problem is really much simpler. Although by no general rule can it
be said that the Imghad originally belonged to this or to that
people, they are all clearly the descendants of groups or
individuals captured in war and subsequently released from bondage
to form a caste enjoying a certain measure of freedom, and having a
separate legal or civil existence under something more than the
mere political suzerainty of the noble tribe which originally
possessed them. In this first stage, the noble tribe represents the
original pure Tuareg race, while the oldest Imghad are the first
extraneous people whom they conquered, in some cases perhaps as
early as in the Neolithic ages. “It is necessary,” says
Bates,<a id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class=
"fnanchor">[126]</a> with great justice, “to state emphatically
that the division into Imghad and Imajeghan is so ancient that the
Saharan Berbers preserve no knowledge of its origin.” This
antiquity may be held to account for the complete national fusion
which has taken place among the two castes: nearly all Imghad would
utterly fail to grasp a suggestion that they were not to-day as
much Tuareg as their Imajeghan overlords, however they may dislike
and abuse the latter.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_138">[138]</span> As time went on more and more Imghad were
added to the race, each group being subject to the noble tribe
responsible for its conquest. The possibility of a group of people
becoming the Imghad of an Imghad tribe was precluded by the
relations obtaining between serfs and nobles, whereby it is the
sole prerogative of the latter to wage war or make peace. Should an
Imghad tribe capture slaves in war they could not be manumitted
except by the Imajegh tribe, the lords of the victorious Imghad;
and by the act of manumission the newly-acquired slaves would then
become the equals of their Imghad conquerors under the dominion of
the Imajeghan concerned.</p>
<p>The Imghad of Air may be divided into three categories whose
history is so intimately bound up with the noble tribes that it
cannot be considered separately. There are the Imghad whose
association with their respective Imajeghan dates from before their
advent to Air; their origin must be looked for in the Fezzan or
elsewhere at some very early date. Secondly, there are the Imghad
who were the original inhabitants of Air before the Tuareg came,
and who by some agreement at the time, like the traditional one of
Maket n’Ikelan,<a id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a> were not enslaved but allowed to
continue living in the country side by side with the new arrivals
in a state of vassalage or semi-servitude. Lastly, there are the
Imghad who are either Arabs, Tuareg of other divisions, or negroids
from the south captured in the course of raids from Air, in some
cases as recently as a generation ago. With these different origins
it is not surprising to find among the Air Imghad both a strongly
negroid type, a non-negroid and non-Tuareg type, and a type showing
the fine features and complexion characteristic of the Imajeghan
themselves. The first type is the pre-Tuareg population of Air. It
is the most common, if only for the reason that negroid
characteristics always appear to be dominant in the cross-breeding
which ensued. The second type represents the Arab or Berber element
acquired by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
conquest. The third type represents the subjugated groups of
Imajeghan of other divisions.<a id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Of the latter category
are, for instance, the Kel Ahaggar, Imghad of the Kel Gharus, who
were originally nobles from the great northern division of the
Tuareg. Many of the Kel Ferwan Imghad are believed to be Arabs or
Tuareg of the west, captured comparatively recently on raids into
the Aulimmiden territory. The Kel Nugguru are the freed slaves of
the Añastafidet, the administrative head of the Kel Owi
confederation: they have become so prosperous that they are now
laying claim to be of noble origin, a pretension which no
right-minded Imajegh in Air will admit for a moment. But it is
almost impossible nowadays to trace the history of each Imghad
tribe in detail. Generally, in the absence of more precise data, it
may be assumed that those Imghad tribes which have “I names” are
the oldest; for here the process of assimilation to the mass of the
Tuareg race is most complete, either on account of the length of
their mutual association or owing to the fact that they were
originally themselves of the same race; the “Kel name” Imghad, on
the other hand, are probably more recent additions.<a id=
"FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class=
"fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
<p>The confusion reigning on the subject of the “Black” and “White”
Tuareg in the minds of the few people in Europe who have ever heard
of the race is due to the practice in the north of the servile
wearing a white, and the nobles a black, veil. But a “Black”
Tuareg, being a noble, will, in the vast majority of cases, have a
much fairer complexion and more European features than a “White,”
or servile Tuareg. In Air the colour of the veil affords no means
of distinguishing the caste of the wearer. The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[140]</span> best veils, being made in the south, are
consequently cheaper in Air than in the north, and this is probably
the reason why Imajeghan and Imghad alike in Air wear the
indigo-black Tagilmus. When a white veil is seen, it usually means
that the wearer is too poor to buy a proper black one and has had
to resort to some makeshift torn from the bottom of his robe.</p>
<p>Slaves, domestic or pastoral, do not wear the face veil at all.
This is the essential outward difference between them and the
Imghad. The latter, whatever their origin, are considered to be a
part of the Tuareg people; the former cannot be so, for they are
simply accounted to belong, as camels do, to the People of the
Veil.</p>
<p>The exact status of the Imghad, or “meratha” (merathra) as they
are called by the Arabs in Fezzan, is somewhat difficult to define.
There is no adequate translation in any European language of the
word “amghid.”<a id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The process of their original
enslavement and subsequent release to form a category of people who
have achieved partial but not complete freedom has, I think, no
parallel in Europe except in a modified form in the state of
vassalage. Yet, as “servile” conveys too narrow and definite a
relationship, so “vassal” is certainly too broad a term. In the
state of servility or, to coin a word, “imghadage” to which the
pre-Tuareg inhabitants of Air appear to have been reduced, the
process of enslavement and release may be said to have taken place
only as a legal fiction, and not, if the tradition is to be
accepted as accurate, in real fact. The general practice seems to
have been that when large groups of people were subjugated or
captured in war they were simultaneously released into the state of
imghadage, but when individuals or a few persons were acquired by
force or by purchase, they were only manumitted in the course of
time, if at all, and incorporated at some later date into an Imghad
tribe or village already in existence.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to slaves, the Imghad are not
bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> individually,
but collectively, and not to individuals, but to a noble tribe or
group of tribes. They are in no sense considered to be the property
of the latter; but the relationship is closer than that of suzerain
and vassal. It is not within the power of an Imghad tribe to change
its allegiance, since in the first instance its members were
theoretically at least the property of its overlord tribe; they owe
their separate existence to an act of manumission freely and
voluntarily accomplished. A change of allegiance could occur only
if a servile tribe were captured in whole or in part; it follows
that when this has occurred one servile tribe might owe allegiance
in several parts to different noble groups.<a id=
"FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a> The bond between them consists of the right of
the responsible noble tribe alone, and therefore of its chief, to
administer justice among the dependent Imghad, either in small
cases by tacitly confirming the verdict of their own headman, or in
more weighty matters by express reference. The Imghad tribe may be
fined or punished collectively by their lords, and would have no
right to appeal to the Amenokal without permission. For the
Amenokal to interfere on behalf of an Imghad tribe would constitute
a breach of tribal custom and ensure a rebuff, if not worse. A
certain proportion of the marriage portions payable in the Imghad
tribes goes to their Imajeghan, who have the right to give or
withhold consent to these contracts. One of the functions of the
Imghad is to take complete charge of and use the camels of their
lords for long periods or to trade with them on their behalf. In
such cases the Imghad act as the agents of the nobles, each one of
whom has a right to ask the servile tribe as a whole to undertake
these duties. But such obligations are imposed collectively on the
tribe and not on any one Imghad. It is the custom to share the
offspring of the camels thus herded in equal shares, though in the
event of any of the animals dying whilst under the charge of the
Imghad, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> latter
are collectively responsible for making good the loss, save in
extenuating circumstances. Conversely, the nobles are, in every
case,<a id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class=
"fnanchor">[132]</a> the protectors of their dependents. The
relations between Imghad and Imajeghan are a mixture of those
obtaining under the feudalism of Europe and the “client” system of
Rome.</p>
<p>A consequence of the interruption of caravan traffic and the
disappearance of one of the principal sources of revenue of the
noble Tuareg is that the Imghad as camel herders, and generally
speaking as the more laborious members of the community, have
gained where the nobles have lost.</p>
<p>Prosperity is emancipating the Imghad, and is materially
assisting the breakdown of social distinctions which in time will
survive only in the philosophic contemplation of the Imajeghan
dreaming idly of the return of better days. The Imghad tribes used
to be the unquestioning allies of their overlords in war; their
numbers contributed greatly to the strength of any Imajegh tribe.
Though they might not make war on their own initiative, the Imghad
carried and still carry weapons.<a id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> They used to go on raids
with their masters, or, if the Imajeghan were busy elsewhere,
represent them with their masters’ camels and the weight of their
own right arms. But the chiefs of the Imghad were never more than
subordinates, or at the most advisers to the nobles.</p>
<p>To-day this unquestioning subservience has almost disappeared
and we even find Khodi, chief of the Kel Nugguru, disputing with
the noble Ahodu the leadership of the village of Auderas. This
issue was one of great importance in local politics and originally
arose out of the disputed ownership of certain palms which had been
given to Ahodu when he was installed as head of the village as a
reward for service rendered by him to the Foureau-Lamy expedition.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> village is on
the edge of the Kel Nugguru country, while Ahodu in fact comes from
a northern tribe, the Kel Tadek, who have no real concern with this
district. The impossibility of reconciling the tribal and settled
organisations was clearly demonstrated in every aspect of this
controversy. Khodi, living as a nomad with his people and camels at
some distance from the village, sought, without success, to govern
the community through various representatives, while Ahodu, who had
given up wandering, was suspended by the French during the
settlement of the legal case, and sat in the village watching
mistake after mistake being made. Under the old system Khodi could
never have pretended to dispute with a noble the position of chief
of a large village: in fact an Imghad tribe without a protecting
noble overlord would have been unlikely to administer a village at
all. Similarly among the Ahaggaren Imghad of the Kel Gharus, a man
of servile origin, Bilalen by name, has come to share with T’iaman
the lordship of a once noble people of the north, a position of
such importance that he is regarded as one of the most influential
chiefs in Air. Bilalen has only become associated with the
Ahaggaren by marriage; he could never have achieved even this, much
less could he have attained so powerful a following in the country,
under the old <em>régime</em>.</p>

<a href="images/map06.jpg"><img src='images/map06.jpg' alt=''></a>
<p class="cp2"><em>Note.</em>—The scheme is largely theoretical, as
the Amenokal has rarely had much authority over any tribes except
the People of the King. His authority over a part of the Aulimmiden
has been even more nominal and has varied considerably from time to
time.</p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In addition to the social distinctions between nobles and serfs,
the Tuareg attach great importance to tribal classification. Among
the inhabitants of the mountains a man will describe himself as,
say, “Mokhammad of the Kel Such-and-such of the Kel Owi,” or of the
other category, which is called the “People of the King,” as the
case might be. These two great tribal divisions (there were three
before the departure of the Kel Geres for the Southland) will be
referred to in detail when the history of the migrations of the Air
Tuareg is considered. The divisions are absolute; a tribe either is
of the Kel Owi or is not of the Kel Owi. There is usually never any
doubt; the erroneous attribution of a man’s tribe to the Kel Owi
confederation would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
provoke the indignant rejoinder that his clan were “People of the
King” and did not “belong (<em>sic</em>) to the Añastafidet.” The
distinction means all that the difference between an ancient landed
nobility and a <em>parvenu</em> commercial aristocracy denotes.
Many of the older men of the “People of the King” go so far as to
say that there are no nobles among the Kel Owi at all.<a id=
"FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class=
"fnanchor">[134]</a> Apart from their slightly different ethnic
origin, the principal reason why the Kel Owi have stood apart from
the other tribes is that they possess an administrative leader of
their own who represents the whole confederation; as they say, “he
<em>speaks</em> for them to the Amenokal at Agades.” He is called
the Añastafidet, the Child of Tafidet. The non-Kel Owi tribes, on
the other hand, have no single leader other than the king; in their
case each tribal chieftain transacts the business of his own tribe
with the former independently of the other chiefs.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> For them the Amenokal of Air
assumes the dual function of nominal ruler of the whole country and
of direct overlord of certain tribes.</p>
<p>In accordance with the democratic traditions of the Tuareg, the
Añastafidet,<a id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class=
"fnanchor">[135]</a> like the Sultan, is elected. He must be a
noble, but need not always be chosen from the same family. He is
elected for a period of three years, but his tenure of office is
really dependent upon a yearly revision by the Kel Owi tribes when
they concentrate in the autumn to go with the salt caravan to
Bilma. The tribal groups mainly responsible for the choice are the
Kel Tafidet and Kel Azañieres; the Ikazkazan, being the junior
group of the confederation, have little voice. The Añastafidet’s
badge of office<a id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136"
class="fnanchor">[136]</a> is a drum; he retains no authority on
leaving office, though it entitles him to a certain degree of
respect, and leads to his being consulted on State matters. In
practice if the Añastafidet is reasonably capable he is confirmed
in power for a succession of three-year periods. During the last
fifty years there have been in all about six Añastafidets; one, I
think the last holder of the office, is at present living at
Zawzawa in Damergu. The Añastafidet’s official place of residence
was at Assode in Central Air, but since the evacuation of the north
he has been living at Agades in direct touch with the Amenokal. His
principal duties are to represent the confederation at the Court of
the Sultan and maintain the freedom of transit through Air and
Damergu for caravans, on which the prosperity of the tribes
depends. Trade with the north and the position of the Kel Owi in
Air astride the great caravan road which passes from north to
south, east of the Central massifs, have in effect combined to
place the foreign relations of all the Air people with Ghat and the
Fezzan in the hands of the Añastafidet, business with the
potentates of the south, on the other hand, being, as has already
been stated, in the hands of the Amenokal at Agades.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> breakdown of
the trans-desert traffic during the war deprived the Kel Owi of
most of their prosperity and the Añastafidet of his work.</p>
<p>The Añastafidet was assisted in his duties by four agents, two
of whom dealt with local business, while the other two lived in the
Southland to assist the Kel Owi tribes in their transactions there.
Neither the Añastafidet nor his agents ever seem to have received a
salary, and the former at least was expected to give munificent
presents, but no doubt their official positions brought perquisites
which compensated for any outlay. As in the case of the Sultan, the
importance of the Añastafidet’s office depends entirely on the
personality of the holder. When von Bary visited the country,
Belkho, chief of the Igermaden tribe, living at Ajiru in Eastern
Air, thanks to his military prowess and political wisdom, was the
<em>de facto</em> ruler of the whole country. His relations with
the Amenokal were strained, even though he had him more or less
under his influence; the Añastafidet had become of so little moment
that he is only once mentioned by this traveller.<a id=
"FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class=
"fnanchor">[137]</a> In Barth’s day, when Air was under the
domination of Annur, another Kel Owi chief of the same type, the
Añastafidet was a mere shadow in the land.</p>
<p>The Añastafidet doubtless represents the surviving functions of
a Kel Owi Amenokal. The restriction of his duties was probably the
result of a compromise arrived at when the Kel Owi entered Air and
found an Amenokal already established in the country, supported by
the Kel Geres and the various tribes known as the “People of the
King.” The more intimate inter-tribal relations between the various
units of the Kel Owi confederation and the organisation of the
“People of the King” will be referred to hereafter in detail.</p>
<p>The system by which the Kel Owi have an administrative leader
who seems to have practically no warlike or judicial functions has
in no way modified the tribal or social organisation<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> of the confederation. As in
the case of all the Tuareg tribes, other than those which have
become entirely sedentary, the government of each unit, large and
small, is patriarchal and similar to that of Bedawin tribes. The
chief of a noble tribe is the leader in war and the dispenser of
justice in peace. The functions are not necessarily hereditary. In
council with the heads of families he exercises authority over the
Imghad tribes associated with his clan, through the chiefs of these
servile groups in the manner already described. The council of the
heads of families is of great importance, but plays an advisory
rather than an executive part. The heads of families rule their own
households, including their slaves.</p>
<p>Within ill-defined limits, certain tribes are grouped together
under a common leader known as the “agoalla” or “agwalla.” This
usually occurs in the case of tribes which are nearly related to
each other. Three groups in the Kel Owi division have already been
mentioned; in two of these, the Kel Tafidet and Kel Azañieres, the
office of “agoalla” is said<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> to be hereditary, but I
have been unable to find any confirmation of this except in so far
as the son of a man who, by his personal ascendancy, has secured
control over more than one tribe, would probably more easily step
into his father’s shoes than another person. The grouping of tribes
may also occur for military reasons, but in such cases it has a
tendency to be of a temporary character. It is best to assume that
the tribe is the unit of Tuareg society and that the tribal chiefs
are the elements of which their Government is constructed.
“Agoallas” are an exotic form principally due to individual
personality or temporary conditions prevailing over long-standing
customs.</p>
<p>Tribes sometimes group themselves into temporary or permanent
alliances. The former probably spring from military exigencies, the
latter may be due to common origins in the recent past. Such
aggregations as the Kel<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> Azañieres and Kel Tafidet in the Kel Owi
tribes are so obviously due to common tribal origins that they
require no further examination. But the Kel Owi confederation in
Air plays a far larger rôle than do mere tribal alliances. Here is
no mere question of relationship or community of origin, but a more
strict bond, which, however, cannot be defined. Such groups as
these have been termed confederations, though the term is a little
misleading, as no unity of government is implied. The origin of the
confederation, which carries with it more moral than material
obligations, is to be explained by the entry of the Kel Owi tribes
into Air as a mass of people confronted by an already established
hostile or at least jealous population of the same race as
themselves. It followed that the new arrivals would tend to hold
together and act with one another. The conditions of the
confederation nevertheless have been such that the representative
is only an administrative head and not a ruler. He is there to
embody a common policy and to dictate one. Loose as these bonds
have been they have served the Kel Owi in good stead, for their
commerce has gained by co-operation at the expense of their rivals,
the “People of the King,” who in the absence of any organisation
have been forced to rely on the fickle ties of common jealousy. How
far there are groups or confederations like the Kel Owi within the
larger northern division of Azger or Ahaggar I cannot say, but the
former are a confederation as the people of Air generally never
have been.</p>
<p>Much has already been said of the status of the Tuareg men and
their tribal organisation, but before it is possible to consider
their family life, the method they follow in tracing their descent
must be described. A man’s status, in Air, as elsewhere among the
Tuareg, is determined by the caste and allegiance of his mother.
Survivals of a matriarchal state of society are numerous among the
People of the Veil. They colour the whole life of the race. A
woman, they say, carries her children before they are
born,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> and so they
belong to her and not to the father. “After all,” as one of them
said to me when we had been discussing this question for some time,
“when you buy a cow camel in calf, the calf is yours and not the
property of the man who sold the camel to you. It is the same with
women,” he added; and he seemed to me to have some show of logic.
Our medieval (and perhaps modern) lawyers would have said instead,
“partus sequitur ventrem,” but he would have meant the same as my
Tuareg friend. If a woman marries a man in her own tribe the
children, of course, belong to that tribe, but if she marries away
from her people they belong to her own, and not to her husband’s
clan. In this case, were the husband to predecease his wife, the
children and their mother would return to live with her tribe. If
the father survives, the children usually go on living with him for
a time, but as they belong to their mother’s tribe in any event,
they eventually return there. Should inter-tribal hostilities break
out they must leave their father and fight for their mother’s
tribe, even against their own parent if need so be. Until this is
understood the relationships of the Tuareg appear very puzzling to
the traveller. When I first met Ahodu he informed me that he was of
the Kel Tadek people, who are Kel Amenokal, but he had a
half-brother and a paternal cousin who belonged to the Añastafidet.
It appears that the fathers of Ahodu and Efale, the famous eastern
guide, were brothers of a man in the noble Kel Fares of the Kel Owi
confederation. Ahodu’s father took a wife from the Kel Tadek, so
the son became a member of the latter tribe, whereas Efale’s father
married within the confederation. The maternal allegiance is so
strong that, though proud of his father’s repute as a holy man and
representative of the fifth generation of keepers of the mosque of
Tefgun near Iferuan, Ahodu used to speak of the Kel Owi in
disparaging terms when comparing their recent origin with the
antiquity of the Kel Tadek and the other “People of the
Amenokal.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The following
examples of definite cases may assist in understanding the
position:</p>
<p>1. A man of the noble Kel Tadek marries a woman of the noble Kel
Ferwan. The children are Kel Ferwan, but will live with the father
until his death or the divorce of the mother, when they return with
her to her own tribe.</p>
<p>2. A man of the noble Kel Tadek married a woman of the Imghad of
the Kel Ferwan. The children will normally be Imghad of the Kel
Ferwan.</p>
<p>3. If a man marries a slave woman of another tribe, this woman
has become the property of the husband’s tribe by his purchase or
payment of the marriage portion, and the children belong to the
father. This occurred in Ahodu’s case. One day the Kel Gharus came
over and stole eight slaves belonging to the Kel Tadek, who
proceeded to retake them. The slaves in question were Kanuri people
of Damagerim. The Kel Gharus appealed to the religious court at
Agades, which awarded four slaves to each tribe. Later two of those
allotted to the Kel Gharus ran away to the Kel Tadek, who were
allowed to keep them on the ground that they had been ill-treated
by their former masters. One of these two women Ahodu married, and
his son is considered to belong to his own clan and not to his
wife’s former tribe. In this case Ahodu nevertheless had to pay
some compensation to the former masters of his wife.</p>
<p>The derivation of tribal allegiance through the female line has
carried in its train the consequence that a man or woman’s social
status is always determined by that of the mother. But the
restricted number of noble women, the deference and respect paid to
them, and the impossibility of taking them as concubines have
combined to diminish the numbers of Imajeghan as compared with the
Imghad. The hard-and-fast rule among all the Tuareg, that nobles
can only be born of a noble mother irrespective of the caste of the
father, has done much to preserve the type and characteristics of
the race. In recent years the custom has tended to break down, for
where a noble father,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_151">[151]</span> who has taken unto himself a servile wife,
is sufficiently powerful to assert himself he will often succeed in
passing off his sons and daughters as Imajeghan. Ahodu has done so
with his boy; but had this been impossible the child would have
been accounted of the Irejanaten or mixed people. The old laws of
succession are said by von Bary to have become especially slack
among the Kel Owi, but even here the status of noble women has
remained so unassailable that it would still be impossible to-day
for them to marry outside their own class.</p>
<p>The laws of inheritance and succession also show the strength of
the matriarchal tradition. Although hereditary office is rare among
the Tuareg nowadays, it seems to have been more frequent in the
past.<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class=
"fnanchor">[139]</a> Ibn Batutah states that the heir of the Sultan
of Tekadda was the son of the ruler’s sister.<a id=
"FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a> Similarly of the Mesufa who were Tuareg, he
records that descent is traced through the maternal uncle, while
inherited property passes from a deceased man to the children of
his sister to the exclusion of his own family.<a id=
"FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class=
"fnanchor">[141]</a> The traveller adds that nowhere except among
the infidel Indians of Malabar did he observe a similar state of
things.<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class=
"fnanchor">[142]</a> Bates thinks that Egyptian records tend to
show that the succession of the chieftainship of the Meshwesh
Libyans passed in the female line. The genealogy of many of the
kings of Agades is recorded by their female parentage. The Tuareg
of Ghat not only treat their women-folk in much the same way as
their brethren further south, but Richardson specifically states
that the succession of the chiefs and Sultans of those parts is
similar to the practice of the Tekadda house and at Agades. It is
the son of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
sister of the Sultan who succeeds.<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It seems clear that
before the advent of Islam, which has tended to modify the system,
the Tuareg had a completely matriarchal organisation. In this
earlier state of society may perhaps be found the explanation of
the reputed Amazons of the west of North Africa, recorded by
Diodorus Siculus in a grossly exaggerated version of some story
which he had probably heard concerning the status of certain Libyan
women.<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class=
"fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
<p>I know of no reason to suppose that these matriarchal customs
were derived from association with the negro people; the reverse is
quite as likely to have occurred, as the culture contacts of North
Africa, following the trend of migration, seem to have taken a
course from north to south and not the opposite direction.<a id=
"FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class=
"fnanchor">[145]</a> The matter is one of great interest,<a id=
"FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class=
"fnanchor">[146]</a> for the matriarchate is found in a highly
developed state in Ashanti, and it would be of interest in
connection with the origin of this people to learn if the system
can be traced to a common origin.<a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> I cannot agree with
Barth’s<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class=
"fnanchor">[148]</a> conclusion that the descent of the Sultan of
Tekadda “is certain proof that it was not a pure Berber State, but
rather a Berber dominion ingrafted upon a negro population, exactly
as was the case in Walata,” where he cites the case of the Mesufa.
Moreover, this remark is in contradiction with his previous
assumption,<a id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class=
"fnanchor">[149]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_153">[153]</span> to wit: “With respect to the custom that
the hereditary power does not descend from the father to the son
but to the sister’s son . . . it may be supposed to have belonged
originally to the Berber race; for the Askar (Azger), who have
preserved their original manners tolerably pure, have the same
custom. . . . It may therefore seem doubtful whether . . . this
custom belonged to the black native,” with which statement I am
decidedly inclined to agree. The problem, however, is one which I
prefer on the whole to leave to qualified anthropologists.</p>

<p class="sch">SOCIAL CONDITIONS</p>
<p><span class="sc">By</span> constantly seeing the same people for
nearly three months at Auderas and in the neighbourhood, I was able
to dissipate much of the innate diffidence which the Tuareg display
in their relations with Europeans. Language always remained a
source of difficulty. An interpreter is never satisfactory, more
especially if he belongs to a people whom the Tuareg at heart
really despise, while real proficiency in a language cannot be
attained in so short a time as I had at my disposal. By the end of
my stay in Air I had acquired a sufficient knowledge of Temajegh to
be able to travel comfortably with a guide speaking only that
language, and to collect a considerable amount of vicarious
information, but never at any time was I able to discuss really
abstruse questions. At Auderas I was lucky enough to find that
Ahodu, the chief of the village, had a working knowledge of Arabic
which was almost as indifferent as my own; but we both made up for
lack of grammar by volubility. The local “inisilm,” or holy man,
named El Mintaka, was a Ghati who had been settled for fifteen
years in Air, where he had taken a Tuareg wife. He, of course,
spoke Arabic in addition to Temajegh, and acted as scribe to Ahodu,
who could neither read nor write. With these two men in the
village, with my servant Amadu, a Fulani soldier who had served
with distinction in the West African Frontier Force during the war,
and had a working knowledge of English and Hausa, which most of the
Air Tuareg speak, and with my interpreter Ali, a man from Ghat, I
found myself quite at my ease.</p>
<p>This Ali ibn Tama el Ghati had lived for some years in Kano and
had travelled all over the Central Sudan. He<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_155">[155]</span> was small and very black, but constantly
cheerful and as clever as a tribe of monkeys. Somewhat of a rogue
unless watched, he was tireless and devoted, and proved to be one
of only two natives who, after I had been obliged to return home,
completed the whole journey with Buchanan. He was one of the
original race of Ghat, now called the Atara, who were there before
the Tuareg and Berbers came. Ali spoke no English, but was
loquacious in Hausa, Temajegh and Kanuri; he also spoke some Tebu
and Fulani, in addition, of course, to Arabic. His especial joy was
to wear many different combinations of gay clothes for periods of
about ten days at a time. He would then change his apparel and
adopt another disguise until the novelty of appearing as a Tuareg
or a Hausa or an Arab in turn had worn off.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>On reaching Auderas I took up my residence in some huts which
Ahodu had prepared on the edge of a diminutive plateau between the
main bed of the valley and a secondary affluent. The area between
the valleys and ravines which intersected the little plain was
bare, but the sides of the valleys were covered with vegetation.
About a hundred yards away across a steep gully was Teda Inisilman,
the House of the Holy Men, the smallest of the three hamlets which
together make up Auderas. On the other side of the main stream bed,
where the water-holes of the village were dug in the sand, lay the
larger hamlet called Karnuka, containing the house of El Mintaka.
The third settlement was a few hundred yards further down-stream.
These hamlets were all built of reeds and palm fronds, but the
little plain was covered with what proved to be the ruins of stone
houses, many of which were inhabited until 1915. Teda Inisilman is
the village of the nobles where Ahodu and the only other three
Imajeghan families of the place lived, together with their own
dependent Irawellan and Ikelan, and the Enad or smith, a most
important person in Tuareg society. Down-stream of Teda Inisilman
and Karnuka lay the date-palm groves and most of the
gardens;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> there were
a few above our camp also, in a side valley and in the main bed
under a huge mass of overhanging rock resembling the keep of a
fortress rising high above the sheer side of the stream. To the
south were only dûm palms and the rugged hills, called
Tidrak,<a id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class=
"fnanchor">[150]</a> which formed the further edge of the valley.
Elsewhere the ground was more open. Down-stream to the west were
the low Mafinet and T’ilimsawin hills, joining on to the T’inien
peaks north of the point where my road had emerged from among them
on the way from Agades. To the north the ground rose over a low
ridge to the Erarar (plain) n’Dendemu, the Taghist plateau<a id=
"FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class=
"fnanchor">[151]</a> and the distant peak of Dogam.<a id=
"FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class=
"fnanchor">[152]</a> The glistening black domes of the Abattul and
Efaken peaks were rather nearer, on the far edge of the Auderas
valley itself. A few miles north and north-east, this basin reached
to the foot of the mountain group of Todra, which towers 3000 feet
and more above the valley to a total height of about 5500 feet
above the sea. The rounded sides rose out of a bed of green and
yellow to a crest of bare red rock at the top. The mountain used to
change colour all day, a whitish gleam off the rocks at high noon
giving place to blue-black shadows under storm clouds and in the
evening. At sunset it seemed to glow vivid red from within. It is
one of the most beautiful mountains in the world. The Tuareg regard
Todra and Dogam as one group, but separate from the Bagezan
Mountains, and this is certainly the case. They are reckoned among
the five principal massifs of Air, the others being Taruaji
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> the south, Bila
or Bilet north-west of Todra, and Tamgak which includes the
Azañieres, Tafidet and Taghmeurt ranges in the north.</p>
<p>The advent of Europeans in Auderas caused a certain amount of
excitement, but the novelty soon wore off as the routine of life
was resumed. I was welcomed by Ahodu’s wife and other persons with
a present of fresh dates, which were then ripening,<a id=
"FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class=
"fnanchor">[153]</a> and newly-made cheese, known as T’ikammar,
which is excellent food. The Tuareg live very simply and take so
little trouble about their food that for Europeans it is almost
uneatable. The staple diet is milk and cheese, but the more
sedentary people eat locally grown or imported grain. The millet is
pounded in a mortar as in the south and cooked with water, making a
sort of porridge; but whereas in the Hausa countries this “pura,”
or “fura” as it is called, can be quite palatable when seasoned or
eaten with meat, the Tuareg in Air are too poor and too
lackadaisical to dress it in any way. They often even forget to add
salt, and without it the mess is peculiarly nasty on account of a
certain glutinous consistency which it acquires. The finer flour
obtained from the millet after it is pounded is also mixed with
water and dry powdered cheese and drunk uncooked as very thin
gruel; the dry cheese gives it a sour taste to which in time one
gets used, and then it becomes really rather refreshing if one is
thirsty. It is much better on the march for the stomach than large
quantities of plain water. The drink is called “ghussub” in the
south; it is often the sole means of sustenance of a Tuareg
travelling quickly without baggage or when a scarcity of fuel makes
it impossible to light fires. In the place of millet, guinea corn
is also eaten; it is pounded and baked in embers into a heavy
tasteless cake which is slightly more edible than millet porridge.
The best food in Air is undoubtedly the wheat “kus-kus” of the
Arabs and Berbers in the north: it is made in the same way by
grinding wheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> into
rough flour, and then steaming and rubbing it until it forms grains
about the size of small barley. It is carried dry and can be
prepared by boiling in water or stock for a short time. It has the
great advantage of requiring very little fuel to cook it. With no
other adjunct than a little salt it is very good indeed. During the
latter part of my stay I lived almost exclusively on kus-kus and
rice, with hardly any meat, but as many vegetables as I could
procure. When neither millet, guinea corn nor wheat is available,
the Tuareg collect the seeds of various grasses and grind them,
notably of the grass called Afaza and of the prickly burr grass.
The former is a tall grass with stems of such strength that they
are used when dry with a weft of thin leather strips for making the
stiff mats which are spread upon their Tuareg beds. The stalks grow
as much as five feet high; the grass is dark grey-green when fresh,
or yellow when dry. The burr grass is fortunately rare in Air. One
can only be thankful that Nature has found some useful purpose in
this damnable plant as food for the Tuareg.</p>
<p>Of all the Tuareg food their cheese is best. It is usually made
of equal parts of sheep’s or goat’s and camel’s milk, but any of
them alone will do. The rennet is obtained from the entrails of the
goat; the curds are pressed in matting made of dûm-palm fronds and
formed into cakes about 4 in. × 5 in. × ¾ in. thick. The fresh
cheese is pure white and soft, but nevertheless crisp; it is
delicious with dates or with any other form of food, for it has no
sour or “cheesy” flavour. It dries yellow and hard and is carried
about by all Tuareg as a staple commodity, but in this state
requires soaking or crumbling before use, and acquires rather an
unpleasant sour smell. Butter is made of goat’s or sheep’s milk,
churned in bottle-shaped gourds or in small skins. It is not bad
mixed with kus-kus or rice or in cooking, but indifferent on bread
or biscuits. Meat is very little eaten, for it is a luxury. But
even when an animal is slaughtered and divided up the Tuareg do
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> seem capable of
turning it into a very edible dish. They neither roast nor fry;
they either stew their meat in a pot with vegetables or with millet
porridge, or on the march broil it in the hot sand under the embers
of a fire until it becomes shredded. If ever there is a surplus
supply of meat, it is preserved by soaking in brine and drying in
the sun strung on cords.</p>
<p>The preparation of food in the villages is done by the women, on
the march by the “buzu,” or, where there is no slave present, by
the youngest member of the party, whatever his caste or status, so
long as he has not reached his majority. When there are no minors
or slaves an Amghid does the work, but where all are of the same
caste, the duty reverts once more to the youngest member of the
party. The most arduous function is preparing the millet flour.
Nowadays the millet is almost invariably pounded in a mortar with a
long pestle, and the meal is then graded and separated from the
husk and other impurities by shaking it with a circular motion on a
flat tray. The mortar and long pestle, which is used by men and
women standing up and working alone or pounding rhythmically with
one or more companions, is certainly a southern invention; the
wooden pestle is double-headed and some 3 feet long; the mortar is
cut out of one piece of wood and stands about 12 inches high. The
indigenous and more primitive fashion is to grind grain on the
rudimentary saddle-stone quern, a form which has been preserved
unchanged since prehistoric times. A large flat stone is placed on
the ground, and the person grinding the wheat or millet kneels by
it with a basket under the opposite lip of the stone to catch the
flour as it is made. The wheat or other grain is poured on to the
flat stone and crushed by rubbing it with a saddle-stone or rounded
river pebble about the size of a baby’s head, held in both hands
and worked forwards and backwards. As the grain is crushed the
flour is automatically sorted out and pushed forward into the
basket in front, the heavier meal remaining on the flat stone.
These querns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> may be
seen lying about all over Air on all the deserted sites; the lower
stones can readily be recognised by the broad channel which is worn
along their length. Except for wheat, which is too hard to be
pounded, they have largely been discarded in favour of the handier
mortar and pestle. I do not think a more widespread use of the
quern necessarily indicates that wheat was more extensively eaten
than millet in olden days nor yet that agriculture was formerly
more pursued than nowadays. The explanation of the fact is merely
that pounding grain in a mortar was found a simpler method in a
country where millet was the staple cereal and the consumption of
wheat a luxury. Moreover, the Northern Tuareg when they came to Air
were probably less familiar with millet than with wheat, and only
modified their habits and utensils after they had settled down.</p>
<p>Though certain wild herbs are employed for medicinal purposes, I
know of none which is used in cooking. Besides Afaza and the burr
grass, several other seeds or berries are used by the more nomadic
Tuareg for food; there are said to be some twenty odd varieties in
Air which ripen at various times of the year. The Abisgi
(<i>Capparis sodata</i>) leaf has a biting taste and is sometimes
used as a condiment; the tamarind does not grow so far north; limes
are found only in Bagezan, and are rare. Dates are eaten fresh, or
are preserved by soaking them for a short time in boiling water,
and pressing them into air-tight leather receptacles, which are
then sewn up. The practice of drying dates and threading them on a
string is resorted to in Fashi and Bilma but not in Air.</p>
<p>Food is cooked in pear-shaped earthenware pots of red clay. The
vessels are only half baked when they are manufactured, principally
in the Agades neighbourhood, and have to be fired before they can
be used. They are plain and unornamented, with a lip or rim round
the mouth, which is bound with a cord to prevent cracking. More
elaborate pitchers with a blue design are used for<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> liquids, since the universal
calabash of the south is comparatively rare in Air.<a id=
"FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class=
"fnanchor">[154]</a> These pots are also made near Agades. The
designs appear to be of local origin. The Sudanese jars and pots
with bands of geometric design in straw-coloured slip and blue
pigment are not used in Air. Many small pots for inks, spices and
condiments are found in the houses of Northern Air: black and red
pottery is used for such vessels and for saucers and little bowls.
With the exception of what may be termed the “grape design”
(<a href="#i22">Plate 22</a>), none of the pottery is very
remarkable. The pots used in the urn cemetery at Marandet seem to
have been shaped like the common cooking-pot or with a slightly
more round appearance: they are reported to have stood in saucers
or plates. None of the pottery is wheel-turned.</p>
<p>Auderas being essentially a sedentary and servile community, did
not contain many characteristic noble Tuareg. Neither Ahodu nor his
wife represents the fine physical type of the race, for he is of
somewhat mixed parentage, having, according to his own tradition,
some Arab blood in his veins, while she is a Kanuri woman. Among
the Tuareg, as in all races, it is hard to find the absolutely pure
type. I came across one or two examples, and must count myself
lucky to have seen so many. I was never able to confirm the story
one had so often heard of Tuareg with blue eyes, but such accurate
observers have recorded this feature that its occurrence must be
admitted. In Air it must certainly be most uncommon; nowhere is it
the rule; light brown and grey eyes, however, are not unusual, nor
is it rare to see hair which is not so much black as dark brown and
wavy; it is never crinkled or “fuzzy” unless there has been an
obvious infusion of negro blood. Very fair skins, as fair as among
the people of Southern Europe, are comparatively frequent, but the
transparent white skin of the North is not known: no deduction can
be drawn from this, as skin pigmentation is notoriously<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> unreliable. Fair skins are
held by the Tuareg to represent the purest type: a range of every
shade to the black of the negro occurs. The Tuareg of Air
differentiate the colouring of people somewhat arbitrarily: they
call the pure negro “blue,”<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> but the dark-brown
Hausa, “black”; the Arab is always “white,” whatever shade of
bronze he happens to be; the Tuareg himself is “red,”<a id=
"FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class=
"fnanchor">[156]</a> which is the most complimentary epithet he can
apply to others. Fairness of complexion is much prized and is a
social distinction, though when carried to such extremes as among
Europeans it is apt to be regarded as strange and odd. Certain
tribes in Air are reputed, even among the Tuareg, to be more than
usually fair. When von Bary was in Air his acquaintances seem to
have chaffed him about his celibacy; they offered to find him a
woman of the Iwarwaren tribe, for, they said, she would match his
own complexion.<a id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157"
class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Once on a time in Auderas I dressed
completely as a Tuareg, a disguise which was not difficult, for I
had grown a full dark beard and was very deeply sunburnt all up my
arms and legs from wearing a sleeveless tunic, diminutive shorts
and no shoes or stockings—the ideal garb for hot weather and an
active life. I rode into the village on a great white camel by a
circuitous path: the people were puzzled about my identity, and
some, as I was later told, decided from the colour of my limbs that
I came from the Igdalen tribe. It was typical of the Tuareg that
they eventually recognised not me, but my camel, and so guessed who
I was.</p>

</div>
<p>In spite of the occurrence of many fair-skinned people, it must
be admitted that the vast majority of Imajeghan and Imghad in Air
are comparatively dark, yet these Tuareg are among the purest of
their race. Their skin pigment seems to have changed before other
characteristics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
The darkness of their complexion in Air is accentuated by the prize
set upon indigo clothing, which is so impregnated with dye that it
wears off on the skin of the proud owner, whose ablutions are
conspicuously infrequent. The Tuareg does not believe in washing
unless it is absolutely necessary, and he avers that an
indigo-stained skin is good protection against strong sunlight,
which may or may not be true. In justice to my friends, I must
admit that they washed their clothing, especially their white
trousers, very frequently, and when they washed their person, they
did so very thoroughly from head to foot, with much rubbing and a
prodigious splashing of volumes of water.</p>
<p>The beauty and grace of their bodies are the principal
characteristics of the Tuareg. They are tall, more commonly in the
neighbourhood of six feet than shorter. They look much taller owing
to their flowing robes. When at rest they have little superficial
muscular development; their bodies are not corrugated and knobbly
like the powerfully built Latin: they are more like Nordic folk in
that their limbs and backs are smooth until exerted, when the
muscles stand up hard and tough. Their arms and legs are long and
shapely and exceedingly graceful; they never have flaccid or
cylindrical limbs like Abyssinians or certain Indian races. Their
bones are small. They have wrists and ankles as slender as a
woman’s; it is noteworthy that whatever the degree of negro
admixture this sign of high breeding is the last to disappear. It
is a most infallible mark of pure Tuareg parentage. With it, of
course, go slenderness and refinement of hands and fingers. The men
never grow fat: they are hard and fit and dry like the nerve of a
bow, or a spring in tension. Of all their characteristics the one I
have most vividly in mind is their grace of carriage. The men are
born to walk and move as kings, they stride along swiftly and
easily, like Princes of the Earth, fearing no man, cringing before
none, and consciously superior to other people.</p>
<p>Grace and mystery are added to their appearance by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> veil over the
face and by their long black robes, which are called “takatkat.”
They are of plain indigo black cotton stuff, and though some are
embroidered on the breast, the old-fashioned men shun such ornament
as ostentatious. More rarely their robes are white. Their dress, to
be in good taste, must above all be simple. Silk is hardly known
and not in great demand: plain native cloth made up of many narrow
slips sewn together to the desired width is esteemed superior to
the European sorts. Buchanan had brought for presents an indigo
stuff of excellent quality, made in Lancashire and better than
anything of the sort that could be bought in Kano. It was much
appreciated, but as it had a thin white stripe in it, not a single
man would wear it for a dress. They gave it to their women for
skirts. Broad Moslem trousers called “takirbai” are worn beneath
the robe; they are always of white cotton. Sometimes a tanned goat
or sheep skin is worn around the loins below the trousers, more
especially in bush country where burr grass is very
prevalent.<a id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class=
"fnanchor">[158]</a></p>
<p>The best sandals used to be made in Agades only, but since the
emigration of so many craftsmen from Air they can now also be
procured in Kano, and more cheaply. They are of a shape peculiar to
the Tuareg and are much in demand all over the Sahara. The form is
pleasing: it is wide and round under the toes, slender under the
instep, and at the heel, and just broad enough to carry the weight
of the body. They are made of two thicknesses sewn together with
neat white raw-hide stitching; the top piece is of red leather with
a stained black border: the lower piece is of raw hide. Two red
straps from the sides level with the instep join a thong, which
passes under the top leather and is fastened between the two
thicknesses of the sole in order to protect the sewing from wear on
the ground. The thong is slipped between the big and second toes;
the red straps pass over the breadth of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[165]</span> foot to the sides of the sandal. The
heel is free. It is the ideal footwear in sandy country, as nothing
can collect on the surface and rub the foot. I wore nothing else
for nine months and can vouch for the comfort of these sandals.
They are usually made in two sizes<a id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>; the correct pattern for
all those who can afford them is 12 inches long and 6 inches broad
across the toes. This great surface, leaving several inches all
round the breadth of the foot, gives much support on loose sand, on
which it rests like a platform. Many other forms of improvised
sandals are made, covering the sole and sometimes the sides of the
foot, but the most ingenious home-made type I saw was woven in a
few minutes of green dûm-palm fronds. These sandals were really a
sole of palm matting under the foot: they have the advantage of
costing nothing and, when the fronds are still green, of being
supple and springy in any weather, whereas the leather sandals
become flaccid on wet ground. They are, however, not proof against
long acacia thorns, as I learnt to my cost. During the rains I used
to have a new pair made for me every day by Ahodu’s son, aged nine,
at the grossly excessive rate of about 6<em>d.</em> a dozen. The
best leather sandals cost as much as 6<em>s.</em> a pair at Agades
nowadays.</p>
<p>Walking barefoot over loose sand in time produces severe cracks
in the sole of the foot. The ball of the big toe and the inside
part of the foot are particularly liable to be affected. In cold
dry weather it is common to see men rubbing fat into the callous
skin of their feet and warming them in front of a fire to soften
the leather, for when a crack has begun to appear it is very
difficult to induce healing. The skin of their feet is so
insensible and thick that men often take a needle and thread and
sew up their sole as one would mend a sandal. Some form of
foot-wear is likewise desirable when there are many thorns about,
and in the bush, where burrs find their way into the tender skin
between the toes. As I often wore no foot-covering at all my feet
became very hard, but I contrived on several<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_166">[166]</span> occasions to pick up thorns, which went
as much as three-quarters of an inch into the sole of my foot. I
well remember how the extraction of these spikes used to cause a
most peculiar form of pain; it produced almost physical sickness.
Curiously enough, these wounds never seemed to get septic, and I
have always wondered why. For several months I did have septic
sores on my feet and legs whenever a rub or scratch occurred, but
they were principally due to being run down after malaria and the
rainy season. Acacia thorns or burrs in my feet never became
infected.</p>
<p>With a veil, robe, trousers and sandals, the wardrobe of the
Tuareg is complete. Some carry a white blanket of heavy native
cotton stuff known in Nigeria as “Kano cloth,” woven in six-inch
strips sewn together, with a blue border and fringe. But the
article is a product of the Southland and almost seems to be
considered a luxury in Air, where few men have any additional
clothing or covering in cold weather. Some wear the conical hats of
Kano basket-ware associated with the Hausa countries, but the
practice is regarded as an affectation and is not very
common.<a id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class=
"fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
<p>The scantiness of the clothing of the Tuareg in Air is very
remarkable. Their robe is admirably suited for hot weather, since
any covering which hangs in loose folds over the back is good
protection against the sun. The garment consists of two large
squares of stuff, forming the front and back, the height of a man’s
shoulder, or say about 5 feet × 5 feet. The two lower corners of
the squares are sewn together, the bottom and sides are left open.
The top is sewn up except for a space of about 18 inches where the
head is put through, and a slit with a pocket is cut on the breast.
The sides of the upper part either fall down the arms or can be
looped up over the shoulders to leave them clear. As the sides are
open, the circulation of air under the robe is quite free. In cold
weather the ample volume of the robe enables it to be wrapped well
around the body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
nevertheless it is very inadequate protection when the thermometer
falls to freezing point. It speaks highly of the hardihood of these
people that they wear this garment only throughout the year in
spite of variations in temperature, such as in December I
encountered on my way south through Azawagh, of as much as 60° F.
in twenty-four hours. The three Tuareg with me had no sort of extra
covering for the night until I gave them a ground sheet in which to
wrap themselves near the fire. But they discarded it, because the
canvas, as they said, “attracted the cold” more than did the sand.
The dying embers of a fire warmed the soles of their feet, but the
rest of their bodies must have been frozen.</p>
<p>The Tuareg woman wears a long piece of indigo cloth rolled round
her body as a skirt and tucked in at the waist. Over her shoulders
is a garment which resembles a sleeveless coat, but is really a
small square of light indigo or black stuff with a hole for the
head. The ends hang down in front and behind to the level of the
waist, the sides are open. She never veils her face; the upper
garment, or a dark cloth worn over the head like a nun’s hood, may
be drawn across the face, but more often in coquetry, I think, than
in prudery. This upper garment is sometimes embroidered with a
simple cross-stitch pattern around the neck; usually it is a piece
of plain native cloth made, like the robes of the men, of narrow
bands sewn together. Women who can only afford one piece of stuff
wear it wound round their bodies close under the armpits, though,
as a general rule, it may be said that there is no feeling of
immodesty involved in exposing the body above the waist.<a id=
"FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class=
"fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p>This ease of garb among the women and their unveiled
countenances are in keeping with the perfect freedom which they
enjoy. Irrespective of caste or circumstance, whether they be noble
or slave, rich or poor, the women<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_168">[168]</span> of the People of the Veil are respected by
their men in a manner which has no parallel in my experience. It is
the more significant in a Moslem people, inasmuch as Islam has not
hitherto taught the men of the Eastern world to treat their
women-folk as their equals, still less as their betters. In saying
this much I write in no depreciatory spirit, for the Western world
has happily long ceased to regard the followers of Muhammad’s
teaching of the Faith of the One God as heathen or pagan. But the
morals and ethical code of Islam differ most essentially from those
of the north of Europe and America precisely in regard to women;
and in this respect Islam has lagged behind. But even in European
countries the complete emancipation of women is only a modern
development which may perhaps have just begun in Islam. Yet judged
by our Northern standards the Tuareg have much in common with
ourselves. So strange in Africa seems their conduct to women, that
early travellers called them the Knights-Errant of the Desert
Roads. The extent to which they have earned this name is their
justifiable pride.</p>
<p>Their women have position and prerogatives not yet achieved by
their sisters in many of those countries which we term “civilised.”
The Tuareg women are strong-minded, gifted and intelligent. They
have their share in public life; their advice is proffered and
sought in tribal councils. Contrary to Moslem practice and to that
of many European societies, a Tuareg woman may own property in her
own name, and, more than that, may continue to own and administer
it after her marriage without interference by her husband, who has
no rights over it whatsoever. At death a woman’s property, unless
otherwise disposed of in satisfaction of her expressed wish, is
divided in accordance with the Moslem laws of inheritance, but if
her family has been provided for as custom demands, she may
bequeath what is over as she pleases. There are many instances of
Tuareg women of noble birth being heiresses or receiving a share of
property which has become available,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_169">[169]</span> by conquest or the extinction of some
group, for distribution generally among the community. Sometimes,
if a tribe moves away from an old area, the community goes so far
as to divide up and settle the free land on the chief women, who
become, as Duveyrier has called them,<a id=
"FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class=
"fnanchor">[162]</a> the “femmes douairières” of the Tuareg.</p>
<p>Their bravery is famous in Africa. Instances are not lacking
where they have played great parts in war. In one engagement in Air
the Kel Fadé women led their men into battle, covering them with
their own bodies and those of their children to prevent the French
firing.<a id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class=
"fnanchor">[163]</a> When Musa ag Mastan, the Amenokal of Ahaggar,
went to France in 1910 his sister ruled the people in his stead.
Though no instances are recorded in Air itself of women becoming
chiefs of tribes they rule several villages among the Kel Geres. By
usage and by right their functions are more consultative than
executive. They do not seek election to tribal councils. They enter
them as of right and not in competition, but not even then do they
order men about. Their function is to counsel and to charm. They
make poetry and have their own way. In recent years there seems to
have been only one example in Air of a woman playing a definitely
masculine rôle. Barkasho, of the Ikazkazan, was already an old
woman when, as a small boy, Musa, of the same tribe, who was with
me at one time as a camel-man, knew her. Soon after she married,
Barkasho told her husband that she was going about a man’s work and
proceeded to don the robe, veil and sword of the other sex. She set
off on a raid to the east to avenge some depredations on her
people. As her courage grew and became famous she turned her
attention to the west and led a raid, it is said, as far afield as
the Tademekkat country. On one of these expeditions she lifted,
single-handed, seven camels from a party of three men who were
guarding them. The curious side of Barkasho’s personality was that
when she returned from these excursions, she put off her male
attire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> and quietly
resumed her place and occupations in the household. Evidently,
however, her husband must have become restive, for in the end she
advised him to get rid of her, or at least to marry another woman
as well, since she was useless to him as a wife. But history does
not relate what the husband did. Musa last saw her as an old, old
woman, sitting in front of her hut, looking into the sunset over
the country where she used to raid, and dreaming. I failed in my
endeavours to obtain other stories of women leaders. I found,
therefore, nothing to bear out the Amazonian legend,<a id=
"FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class=
"fnanchor">[164]</a> except the survival of the matriarchal system
generally.</p>
<p>Kahena lives on among the Tuareg only as a memory and as a
proper name. They do not claim as one of their race the Berber
queen who defended Ifrikiya against the Arabs in the seventh
century. Ahodu had heard of her as a woman of the Imajeghan who
were in the north when the Arabs came. “She led these noble people
and defeated the Arabs, it is true, and those Imajeghan were great
people, of course, but she was not one of our people: our people
are older than they; and the Arabs—why, the Arabs have only just
come to the land,” said Ahodu, who, where his own Kel Tadek were
concerned, was always an intolerable snob.</p>
<p>Under Moslem law a man may take unto himself four legitimate
wives in addition to a number of slave concubines. The rules laid
down by the Prophet for the governance of the marital relations of
good Moslems are theoretically, at least, in force among the Tuareg
of Air. In practice, however, monogamy is more frequent than
polygamy. I am not clear whether an explanation of this phenomenon
is to be looked for in a survival of a matriarchal state of society
where one would indeed be led to expect polyandry rather than
polygamy, or whether the reason is rather to be sought in the
economic condition of a people whose poverty does not allow them to
keep more than one wife. I have no hesitation in disagreeing with
Jean when he says<a id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165"
class="fnanchor">[165]</a><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_171">[171]</span> that monogamy is rare and even anomalous in
Air. It does not accord with my personal observations, nor is it
consistent with what I heard of those traditions and conditions
which I was unable to verify. How often has it not been said to me
that “the Imajeghan respect their women, and <em>therefore</em>
have only one wife, not like the negroes, and heathen”? It does not
accord with the conditions governing the status of women as
described by Jean himself, nor yet with the remarks which he makes
on the subject of the matrimonial relations of the Tuareg. It is,
finally, in contradiction with the accounts given by
Duveyrier<a id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class=
"fnanchor">[166]</a> and others of the Northern Tuareg, concerning
whom his enthusiasm even led him into the exaggeration of asserting
that polygamy was unknown.</p>
<p>After considering the question carefully, I have come to the
conclusion that monogamy is probably an old tradition dependent
upon and consistent with the status of Tuareg women, and not a
consequence of economic conditions which have, however, served to
perpetuate the custom. It is certainly connected with the
matriarchate. The practice of concubinage is restricted, and where
it does occur, is usually confined to women of the slave caste. A
noble woman is not, and never could be, a concubine so long as the
status of noble and of serf continues to exist; but if the
maintenance of only one wife were due to economic necessity alone,
the same conditions would not obtain in regard to concubinage in a
community where every additional slave, male or female, is an asset
as a productive unit. The position of women among the Tuareg has no
real parallel in any other Oriental country. Even in Ashanti, where
there are analogies for some of the matriarchal survivals found
among the Tuareg, the exceptional positions of some of the royal
women seem to be less favourable than that of any of the noble and
most other women in Air, where all the sex is held in honour.</p>
<p>At Auderas I played the rôle of doctor to the best of
my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> ability. I found
a great ally in Ahodu’s wife, who, though not a Tuareg by race, had
acquired all their traditions and manners. Her appearance was not
in the least characteristic; her negroid features were frankly ugly
from the European point of view. But she made up for these physical
disadvantages by her unfailing sense of humour and constant
cheerfulness, which are very valuable qualities in Africa. In
general the young Tuareg women are handsome and possessed of
considerable charm. They are smaller in build than the men, but
when their parentage is reasonably pure, they possess the same
aristocratic features and proportions. Their demeanour is modest
and dignified. In this Ahodu’s wife resembled them. She was
perfectly natural and had great quickness of mind. She was what
might be called “une femme du monde.” Ahodu had divorced at least
two previous wives for their uncouth or unrestrained behaviour. He
was devoted to his present one. He always used to speak with pride
of her capability, which he averred was second to no man’s: one
could place complete reliance in her. I made a point of taking her
with me when visiting sick women and children in the hamlets, and
through her tact and presence of mind gradually came to understand
their perfect ease and bearing. In their tents or huts they would
sit and listen without fear or shyness. After the inevitable
diffidence had worn off they talked and were free from awkwardness,
but never familiar like the negro or negroid women. They are gay
but not infantile. They never lose their dignity. Their dress is
staid and sombre like that of their men, with a few ornaments of
beads and silver.<a id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> As they grow older the women of good
family and wealth become fat, especially, as Barth remarks, in “the
hinder parts,” for fatness is a sign of affluence, since it implies
a sufficiency of the good things of life, like slaves and food, to
obviate having to do much manual work. But among the unmarried
women I saw no large-proportioned ladies: indeed few enough even of
the married ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> at
Auderas were fat, indicating, I am sorry to say, the poverty of
most of them. When the women do not run to fat, they age with great
beauty; nearly all the old women looked typical aristocrats and
conscious of their breeding.</p>
<p>The women use henna, which grows in Air, on their finger and toe
nails, and “kohl” (antimony) for their eyes. On festive occasions
they have a curious habit of daubing their cheeks and foreheads
with paint, prepared either from a whitish earth found especially
near Agades, or with red or yellow ochres which occur in several
places. The effect of these colours on different shades of skin is
uniformly ghastly, especially when the more usual yellow pigment is
used, but they apparently like the habit. A possible explanation is
that in the first instance the custom was intended as a symbolic or
conventional method of expressing the respect felt for the fairer
complexions of their original ancestors. The negro is despised in
Air, the “red” man is respected; painting the face was perhaps at
first intended to create an illusion of purer blood. Although the
practice is supposed to be restricted to festive occasions, where
the women have little work to do, they remain daubed most of the
time: this seemed to be the case at T’imia, for instance, where the
women were noble and had plenty of slaves. Tuareg men do not so
adorn themselves.<a id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168"
class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>
<p>Before marriage, which for Oriental women occurs comparatively
late in life, Tuareg girls enjoy a measure of freedom which would
shock even the modern respectable folk of Southern Europe. They do
no work, but dance and sing and make poetry, and in the olden days
they learned to read and write. The art of literature is
unfortunately dying out, but the women still are, as they always
were in the past, the repositories of tradition and learning. Where
the script of the Tuareg is still known<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_174">[174]</span> and freely used, it is the women who are
more versed in it than the men. It is they who teach the children.
When families have slaves, the noble woman does as little work as
she can: her occupation among the poorer people is confined to the
household work or to herding goats and sheep. They make cheese and
butter and sort dates, but they do not as a rule work in the
gardens. They are never beasts of burden. They have never learnt to
weave or spin, but they plait mats and make articles of leather.
The leather-working industry at Agades is exclusively in their
hands. Their knowledge of needlework is limited; the men on the
whole are more skilled than the women at cutting out and sewing
clothes.</p>
<p>The household duties are simple but laborious. The children for
the first few years of their lives are washed frequently, but when
they are able to look after themselves in any way the practice is
abandoned. The hut or tent is cleaned out several times a day and
food has to be prepared. This entails pounding millet in a mortar
and stewing the porridge, or steaming wheat to make kus-kus. The
women eat their food with the men, a privilege often denied their
sex among other Moslems. Among the Kel Ferwan<a id=
"FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class=
"fnanchor">[169]</a> the women eat their food before the men do so,
and the latter have to be content with what is left, which is often
not very much. A man once said to me, to emphasise the good manners
required by usage to be observed before women, that in the olden
days if anyone had dared to break wind in their presence, the
insult was punishable by death alone.</p>
<p>Half the poetry of the Tuareg deals with the loves and
adventures of young men and women. Marriages are not arranged as
among the Arabs. It often happens that a girl has two or more
suitors, when her free choice alone is the deciding factor. It is
common for a girl who is in love with a man to take a camel and
ride all night to see him and then return to her own place, or for
a suitor to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
expeditions of superhuman endurance to see his lady.<a id=
"FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class=
"fnanchor">[170]</a> Fights between rivals are not uncommon.
Illicit love affairs inevitably occur: if they have unfortunate
consequences, the man is called upon to marry the woman, but
infanticide is not unknown. Once married the woman is expected to
behave with decorum and modesty. Public opinion on these matters is
strong. The married state, however, does not prevent a woman
admitting men friends to an intimacy similar to that existing,
perhaps, only among the Anglo-Saxon peoples. In a passage in which
Ibn Batutah describes the Mesufa, who before becoming debased were
of the Western Sanhaja Tuareg, but had in part settled south of
Air, he comments on the status of women in these charming
terms:<a id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class=
"fnanchor">[171]</a></p>
<p>“The women of the Mesufa feel no shame in the presence of men;
nor do they veil their faces. Despite this, they do not omit to
perform their prayers punctually. Anyone who wishes to marry them
can do so without difficulty. . . . In this country the women have
friends and companions among men who are strangers. The men for
their part have companions among women not in their own families.
It often happens for a man to enter his own house to find his wife
with a friend. He will neither disapprove nor make trouble. I (that
is, Ibn Batutah himself) once went into the house of a judge at
Walata after he had given me permission, and found quite a young
and very beautiful woman with him. As I stopped, doubting, and
hesitated, wanting to return on my steps, she began to laugh at my
embarrassment instead of blushing with shame.” The great traveller
is evidently very much shocked, for he goes on: “And yet this man
was a lawyer and a pilgrim. I even heard that he had asked the
Sultan for permission to perform the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176">[176]</span> pilgrimage that year to Mecca, in the
company of this friend. Was it this one or another? I do not know.
. . .” Again, he goes on to describe how he visited the house of
one of his companions of the road and found him sitting on a
carpet, “while in the middle of the house on a couch . . . was his
wife in conversation with a man seated by her side. I asked Abu
Muhammad: ‘Who is that woman?’ ‘It’s my wife,’ he replied. ‘And who
is the individual with her?’ ‘It’s her friend.’ ‘But are you, who
have lived in our countries, quite satisfied with such a state of
affairs—you who know the precepts of the Holy Writ?’ He replied:
‘The relations of women with men in this country bring good and are
correct, they are right and honourable. They give rise to no
suspicion. Our women, as a matter of fact, are not like those in
your country.’”</p>
<p>And that is the whole truth. The Tuareg men and women are not
like the other inhabitants of North Africa. But Ibn Batutah must
have been none the less shocked, because, though Abu Muhammad
invited him to visit him again, he did not go.</p>
<p>Conditions have not changed since those days among the People of
the Veil, but habits which would be considered natural in America
or in England admittedly seem strange in Africa. They are all
summed up in the Tuareg proverb which says: “Men and women towards
each other are for the eyes and for the heart, and not only for the
bed,” as among the Arabs. The consequence of such a frame of mind
is that the men and women of the People of the Veil are often
blessed, or cursed, with love so lasting, so sincere and so devoted
that, like in our own society, it makes or mars a life.</p>
<p>Bates has discussed the marriage customs of the Libyan tribes
mentioned in the classics. While some of these groups of people may
represent the ancestors of the Tuareg, there is no evidence of the
outrageous performances mentioned, for instance, by Herodotus,
having persisted into modern times in Air. Divorce among the Tuareg
is fairly frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
and is carried out in accordance with Moslem prescription, but
adultery is not very common. Prostitution exists, but perhaps, on
the whole, is less common than in more favoured parts of the world.
It is, of course, more frequent in Agades than in the villages, and
in the latter than among the tribes. The harlot is not respected,
and her marriage with a decent man is reprobated.</p>
<p>The husband is required to purchase his wife, the money or
equivalent being paid to her parents. The sum varies from a few
silver francs to several camels. Marriage portions in cattle, sheep
or goats, according to the circumstances of the parents, are
frequently given to women; the “dot” remains the property of the
bride.</p>
<p>The children of the Tuareg, and especially the little girls, are
adorable persons. They are fairer than their parents, largely, I
think, because they wash more often than their elders, but even
discounting this factor they appear to turn darker as they grow up.
Up to the age of seven or eight the children wear no clothes at
all, summer or winter, indoors or out of doors, except perhaps a
rag to keep off the flies when they are asleep. After that, their
first clothes are white cotton shifts. Small boys have their hair
cropped close, except for a crest along the top of the head; in
some tribes, notably in the west of Air, a lock on either side of
the head and a patch on top are sometimes left. Little girls are
allowed long hair until they first put on a smock or cloth about
their waists. At the age of puberty both sexes dress their hair in
one of the several fashions current in Air, usually in small plaits
all over the head; thereafter the boys continue to wear white
shirts, but the girls put on the indigo skirt cloth. The children
are so well brought up that European parents might be envious of
them. I have never met small boys with such perfect manners and so
free from selfishness as I experienced in Air. As soon as they are
old enough to take an interest in things, the boys accompany their
fathers on journeys, to which they are thus gradually broken from
an early age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> They
are made to work and do all the domestic duties that their powers
allow in camp or on the march. They feed the camels on the road
with grass or plants picked by the way; they carry water to their
elders to drink; they bring in stray camels at loading-up time and
hobble them when turned out to graze. The slaves, who prepare the
food, are assisted by the boys and send them out to do all the
hundred and one little jobs that are required. So the boys grow up
to be useful men before they are mature, and in the process learn
the respect which is due to their elders, and their elders show
them such devotion as these pleasant little people deserve. The
training is evidently successful, for nowhere else have I seen
children so thoughtful or so kindly to all and to each other. It
had never been my lot until I met the Tuareg to see a right-minded
boy, for instance, who had been given a sweet or a penny or some
equally valuable object, run off and offer it first to his father
and then to his companions, who refused it. And this I saw not in
an isolated instance, but as an universal practice.</p>
<p>In the primitive conditions of life in Air, infant mortality is
high. The happiest and some of the most successful days I spent in
Air were doctoring people, and especially children, at Auderas.
There are not many diseases in the clean dry mountain air, but
under-feeding and malaria, which comes after the rains, take their
annual toll. The almost miraculous effect of quinine on the fevers
is a very saving grace. One can never have enough quinine, but
fortunately small doses at frequent intervals will keep fever in
check during bad attacks and prevent collapse. Thus can a great
deal be achieved. But it was the good sense of the women, who had
some faith in my elementary remedies, that did most to save several
children of Auderas in the autumn of 1922.</p>
<p>I was interested to find how long women went on suckling their
children. I saw children of three and four years still feeding at
the breast, though they were already eating<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_179">[179]</span> solid food. A woman will go on suckling
an older child for many years so long as her younger ones do not
suffer; she is especially prone to do so if her last baby has died.
In company with most races living under primitive conditions, even
advanced pregnancy does not interfere with a woman’s activities,
nor do mothers suffer much from the effects of childbirth. The
processes of nature take place unassisted: there are neither local
medicine men nor midwives. Women in labour are attended by their
older relations or intimate friends, whose assistance is limited to
massaging the body with hands steeped in butter or fat. Death in
childbirth appears to be rare. Newly-born children are wrapped in
some ragged garment, but receive no especial care. Cradles or
swaddling clothes are unknown; but perhaps a cushion of grass or
leaves for the infant is prepared on the family sleeping mat or
bed. Babies are carried on their mother’s back or by a slave woman,
slung with one tiny leg each side of the woman’s waist, in a fold
of the cloth which constitutes her skirt. The cloth is firmly
rolled round the baby and the woman’s body, and tucked in over the
breast; only the child’s head emerges from this pouch on her back.
So the child sleeps or cries or sucks its finger, and the mother
goes about her daily occupations, pounding millet or plaiting
mats.</p>

<p>Neither at birth nor later is any form of bodily deformation
practised. Such horrors as flattened skulls or filed teeth are
unknown. The only eunuchs in Air are negroes purchased in the
south. As in the case of all good Moslems, the boys are circumcised
at the age of a few months. The diseases which I myself observed in
Air, I must admit, seemed few. Syphilis, malaria, certain digestive
troubles, dysentery, a few minor skin diseases and eye troubles
were the most serious. Syphilis is common, but apparently not very
virulent: its method of propagation and origin are well known to
the natives: in the Northern Sahara it is called the Great Disease.
Von Bary thought that it, like malarial fevers, came from the
Sudan, but there is no reason<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_180">[180]</span> to believe this, for it is very evenly
distributed all over North Africa. The juice of the colocynth as a
purge is believed to do good in cases of venereal disease.
Guinea-worm is fairly common; the milky juice of the Asclepias,
known as <i>Calotropis Procera</i>,<a id=
"FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class=
"fnanchor">[172]</a> which grows all over Air, is said to have a
curative effect, in addition to the usual method of extraction
known to everyone who has travelled in Africa. I saw one case of
tuberculosis of the lungs at Auderas, accompanied by hæmorrhage. It
was rather an interesting case of a woman whose family for three
generations was said to have died of the disease. I was too honest,
I suppose, to profess to be able to cure her, but I need hardly say
that my servant, Amadu, took over the case. He claimed to have
established a complete cure in a few days with some herb which he
had found. My reputation suffered, but my advice to Ahodu to move
her hut to the outskirts of the village was nevertheless admitted
to be reasonable, and was followed. Duveyrier<a id=

"fnanchor">[173]</a> mentions a form of ulcer in the nose, said to
be due to constant sand irritation. He describes hernia from
long-distance camel riding as being frequent: to prevent abdominal
strains from this cause the Tuareg bind a long strip of cotton
stuff tightly about their waists. Von Bary<a id=
"FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class=
"fnanchor">[174]</a> records having seen, in addition to the above
diseases, epilepsy, atrophied children, skin eruptions, small-pox,
hypochondria and madness. He remarks that the Kel Owi seemed to
suffer more from disease than the other tribes, that their women
were very fat, and that they appeared to have irregular periods. My
investigations into local medicine were unproductive. I brought
home some drugs which were used locally as purges, lotions and
astringents, but they were without value. The empiric knowledge of
the Tuareg may yet be worth<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_181">[181]</span> investigating, but has so far disclosed
nothing of any value.</p>
<p>Festivals connected with social life are not interesting. Births
occur without unusual or curious celebrations. The naming of the
child is supposed to be in the hands of the local holy man, but the
mother brings her influence to bear in his choice by suitable
payments. Marriages are celebrated with feast and rejoicing after
the bridegroom has wooed his bride and paid the stipulated portion.
Burials equally follow the Moslem practice. The body is laid in the
ground on its back, the head to the north and the feet to the
south, with the face turned towards Mecca. The rope by which the
body is lowered into the grave is left lying to rot away on the
tomb. The grave is marked by one or two standing stones according
as the deceased is male or female. The graves in Air are intimately
connected with the architecture and dwellings of the Tuareg, and
are dealt with in a later chapter. There are cemeteries all over
Air: the little one now in use at Auderas lies on the south side of
the valley under the hills of Tidrak, opposite the site of our
camp. In the rains, malaria claimed several victims. They were
mournful little processions which I used to see from my hut. One
such occasion particularly impressed itself upon me. I was
returning from South Bagezan one evening, climbing down on a rough
path in a ravine with three camels and three men, when Ahodu, El
Mintaka and a few more appeared, carrying a man to his grave. They
were walking quickly so as to have done as soon as possible,
proclaiming as they went that there was no God but God. They did
that which there was to be done in haste, and returned at their
leisure near sundown when the sky and the mountains of Todra were
on fire. It had been raining and the black clouds were still in
sight, covering the place of sunset. Above, everything was as red
as the light of a blast furnace shining on Todra. Already the
darkness had gathered in the north-east and the stars were coming
out, and the deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
valley with its white, sandy bottom was scarcely seen for the many
trees in it. A chilly wind blew down the valley, waving the palms
and troubling the gardens. As I reached my hut, Ahodu and his men
joined me, and night fell, leaving purple and then dark red and
then a yellow glow in the west. Last of all came the pale zodiacal
light climbing up nearly to the zenith of the night, and the wind
died down. Ahodu did not speak of death because it was unlucky, but
he sat on the sand and told me many things. Ultimately came the
information that a raid of Ahaggaren had plundered some villages in
Kawar. He was afraid they would come on to Air, and that the
village would have to be abandoned, and that his people would have
to retreat into the mountain which towered as a black shadow in the
east. He had left this subject to the last, because there was
nothing in the matter to discuss. The raiders either would or they
would not come. There was a proverb: “Reasoning is the shackle of
the coward.”</p>

<p class="sch">THE MODE OF LIFE OF THE NOMADS</p>
<p><span class="sc">One</span> of my first trips from Auderas was
to the village of Towar,<a id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> which lies under the
south-western spurs of Bagezan on the edge of the plain between
this massif and Todra. Leaving Auderas by a very rough path over
the hills on the south side of the valley, a narrow track with
difficulty climbs up to the watershed of the basin where the
central plain is reached. The northern part of the plain skirting
Todra and Bagezan is covered with black basalt boulders all the way
to Towar. The boulders are polished and range in size from a large
water-melon to an orange. They were probably thrown out from
Bagezan by some volcanic activity, which, in conjunction with later
eruptions at Mount Dogam, also produced the basalt and cinerite
formations in the Auderas valley. The plain is intersected by
several valleys, the head-waters of the Buddei-Telwa system which
drains the southern slopes of Todra. Further east is the Ara
valley, which comes down from the south-east face of Mount Dogam
between Todra and Bagezan. Several valleys descend from the
south-western parts of Bagezan as tributaries to the Ara and Towar,
which both flow into the Etaras, whose waters eventually find their
way east of Taruaji into the River of Agades opposite Akaraq by the
Turayet valley. The Ara valley is particularly important, for it
divides Todra from Bagezan, which are distinct groups and not a
single massif as the Cortier map implies.</p>
<p>The plain between Bagezan and Taruaji is dotted with small
conical hills. There is no vegetation except along<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> the watercourses: between the
boulders a little grass finds a precarious existence. But there are
many gazelle always roaming about. Of the two roads from Auderas to
Towar village, I first tried the northern one, which is also the
shortest. At the point where it crosses a col over a spur of Todra
it proved precipitous and dangerous, but the alternative road, on
the other hand, is more than half as long again, running south-east
from Auderas and then turning north-east to rejoin the first track
at the domed peak of Tegbeshi, some six miles east of Towar. At
Tegbeshi the road to Towar crosses a track from Agades to Northern
Air, running over the pass of the Upper Ara valley not far from the
village of Dogam, which lies on the south slope of the peak. A
branch leads up into the Bagezan mountains by a precipitous ravine
north of Towar village.</p>
<p>After crossing several more tributaries of the Ara and Towar
valleys the village itself is reached, on the east side of the
stream bed. There are two older deserted stone-built settlements,
respectively south and east of the present site, which consist of a
group of straw huts. The dwellings are typical of the Tuareg mode
of hut construction. The frame is made of palm-frond ribs planted
in the ground and tied together at the top; the section of the huts
is consequently nearly parabolic. This framework is covered with
thatch of coarse grass on top and mats round the lower part. The
dwelling is built in one piece; it does not, as in the Southland,
consist of two separate portions, namely, the conical roof and the
vertical wall.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176"
class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The stone houses of the two older
villages point to the former settlements having been more extensive
than the present one. There are small palm groves and a group of
gardens on the banks of the valley, which contains plenty of water
in the sand. The site was deserted during the war and has only
recently been occupied. The population is mixed, but principally
servile, derived from several tribes. The present inhabitants owe
allegiance to the Kel Bagezan (Kel Owi) but the plain all round
belongs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> to the Kel
Nugguru of the chief Khodi, whose camels were pasturing in the
little watercourses of the plain. One of the first people I met on
camping near the village on the east bank was a man from Ghat,
Muhammad, who had left his native town many years ago in the course
of a feud between the leading Tuareg of the city and some
neighbouring villages. He had become completely Tuareg and had
almost forgotten his Arabic. The man, however, I had come to see
was working on his garden, and I sent a friend whom I had brought
from Auderas, one Atagoom, of Ahodu’s group of Kel Tadek, to find
him. Eventually the man returned, and I became aware that I had
found the purest Tuareg type in Air.</p>

<p>I went forward with the intention of greeting T’ekhmedin, but
was met with a look of disdainful inquiry which said more clearly
and forcibly than words could express, “Who the hell are you and
what the devil do you want?” He is one of the most remarkable men
in Air, and the greatest of all the guides to Ghat on the northern
roads of Air. Now barely forty years old, he has done the journey
from Iferuan to Ghat, which is some four hundred miles in a
straight line on the map, more than eighty times. He knows every
stone and mark on all the alternative tracks over this terrible
desert, as well as one may know the way from Hyde Park Corner to
Piccadilly Circus. He is famous all over the Central Sahara, among
the hardest travellers of the world, as the surest and toughest
guide alive. His birth is noble, his spirit uncompromising. He has
fought against the French on many occasions: his activities at Ghat
in connection with the capture of the French post of Janet are
known to all who followed events in North Africa during the war. He
continued to fight against the French when Kaossen came to Air, and
was imprisoned after the termination of that revolution; the
fetter-marks round his ankles will endure until he dies. He had
lost all his property; the rags on his back were pitiful to see,
but his leather tobacco bottle and sheath knife, though almost
falling to pieces, were of a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_186">[186]</span> quality which betokened affluence in the
past. When I saw him he had nothing in the world but a small garden
at Towar, which he had been reduced from high estate to cultivate
like a mere slave. He seemed to be half starved. He was certainly
over-worked, trying to grow enough food to keep life in his wife
and small boy. The French at Agades have offered him pay to join
their Camel Corps as a guide, but T’ekhmedin would have none of
them. I wanted him to come with me as a guide, for his knowledge of
the Central Sahara would have been invaluable to me in my
researches, but he refused to come for pay. After I had broken the
ice and explained my purpose in desiring to see him, T’ekhmedin
began to thaw, and eventually became more affable. In time I
learned to know him well, but in all our relations he never
modified his independent attitude. He said: “I will come with you
when my wife is provided for out of the harvest from my garden, and
when I have placed her in the hands of my relations in T’imia. Then
I will come with you for a month or for a year, but only because I
want to come, and not for pay: if I come, I will go anywhere you
want, but I will not come as your servant. You may give me a
present if you like; you must feed me because I am poor, and give
me a camel to ride, but I will not be paid for any service. I will
come only as your friend because I, <em>I</em> myself, want to
come.” On a second trip to Towar I had occasion to nurse him when
he had fever. He was thus one of the few men I ever saw without the
veil, and as he is so typical of the pure Tuareg, I will copy the
description of his appearance which I recorded in my diary at the
time. “On reaching Towar I found the whole village laid low with
malaria due to the proximity of stagnant wells in the gardens on
the edge of the settlement. So I delivered a lecture on the
desirability of moving the huts further away, and set to work to
dose T’ekhmedin with quinine, the only drug I had with me. He was
very bad, and had been ill ever since he left me at Auderas ten
days before. I persuaded him to come away with me again; he came,
but had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span> a rotten
time riding in the heat of the sun, and arrived rather done up.
Thanks to good food and quinine he is better now. He is a handsome
man, say six feet tall, of slight build, with a small beard and
clipped moustache which, like his hair, is just steeled with grey.
His domed forehead joins a retreating skull running back to a point
behind. He has heavy eyebrow bones and the characteristic Libyan
indentation between the forehead and root of the nose, which from
that point is straight to the flat extremity. The nostrils are
moderately flat and wide, but thin. The lips are not at all
everted, rather the reverse. The upper lip is of the type which is
very short, but in his case is not unduly so. There is an
indentation between the lower lip and chin, which is very firm,
very fine and very pointed. The cheek-bones are prominent but not
high, and from here, accentuating their prominence, the outline of
the face runs straight down to the chin. The ears are small, thin
and flat. The profile is somewhat prorhinous; it is not at all
prognathous. His hands and ankles are as slender as those of a
woman; his body and waist are also slender; as is the case among
all Tuareg, there is no superficial muscular development.”</p>
<p>T’ekhmedin’s colleagues on the north roads, Kelama, who is
nearly blind, and Sattaf, together with Efale, in the Eastern
Desert, enjoy enormous respect in Air and indeed among all Tuareg.
As a race the People of the Veil are all born to travel, but anyone
among them who has a specialist’s knowledge is as important as a
great scientist is in Europe. In general the topographical
knowledge of Air and the surrounding countries has declined since
raiding ceased, for this pastime was as much a sport as anything
else. It is now confined to the people of those areas which are not
under European control, that is, most of Tibesti, all the Fezzan
and southern parts of Tripolitania and the interior of the Spanish
colony of the Rio de Oro. Some of the exploits of the raiding bands
from these areas sound so fantastic that they would hardly be
credited were they not<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_188">[188]</span> established facts. The Arab and Moorish
tribes from Southern Morocco and from the Rio de Oro, for instance,
when they have finished cultivating their scanty fields, turn out
nearly every year for the especial purpose of lifting camels from
the salt caravans between Timbuctoo and Taodenit, but the parties
do not confine their operations to this area if they miss their
objective. They have, on several occasions, gone on until they have
found elsewhere a sufficient number of camels to make their journey
profitable. Thus they have come as far as Damergu and Tegama, south
of Agades, a journey from the Atlantic half-way across North Africa
and back. Once, with consummate humour, a band stole all the camels
of a French Camel Corps patrol in the Tahua area north of Sokoto.
These people usually start out in as large a body of men as they
reckon can water at the wells by the way, and break up into small
parties as soon as they have looted some camels, returning home by
different routes. Although they often lose a part of their booty
and suffer casualties at the hands of the French Camel Corps, their
tactics make them very hard to catch.</p>
<p>The Tebu and Tuareg from the Fezzan raid Kawar and Air. Their
procedure varies considerably, and it is impossible to know which
way they will come or return. One year a party from the north-east
entered Air by the western side and left in an E.S.E. direction.
The raiding season begins as soon as the rains have fallen, when
there is plenty of water all over the Southern Sahara even in the
most inaccessible places. Outlying watering-points which can rarely
be visited are their favourite haunts. The wireless stations at
Agades and Bilma are a serious handicap, for intercommunication
enables the French Camel patrols of different areas to obtain a
start, and very often some idea of the possible roads which the
raiders are following. Yet even so the two Camel Corps platoons in
Air have let many bands slip through their fingers. It is generally
recognised as impossible to prevent a raid reaching its objective;
at the most the raiders can be followed up and brought to action or
forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> to abandon
their loot on the way home. The latter politically is the end kept
in view, for it exposes the raiders to the ridicule of failure
rather than the sympathy of defeat. One of the great difficulties
of defensive operations in the deserts of the Territoires du Niger
is the use of the Tirailleurs Sénégalais as Camel Mounted Troops.
The negro of the coast is not, and never will be, a good camel-man,
and his efficiency cannot compare with that of the natives used by
the French authorities in Southern Algeria, where tribesmen who
have been born and bred in the saddle are enlisted as volunteers.
Here, there is nothing to choose between the capacity of the raider
and his opponent.</p>
<p>The technique of raids is interesting. The size of the bodies
attacking Air must always be limited by the capacity of the
outlying watering-points, which, except in Damergu and Azawagh, are
small. Bands of as few as ten men sometimes operate; a raid of one
hundred men is considered large. They travel astonishing distances
on practically no food or water: a few dates and a little water
serve them for several days. If I were to record the periods of
time for which men have lived without water in the lands of the
People of the Veil, I would be accused of such mendacity that I
will refrain from risking my good name. I will only say that
seventy-two hours without water is an occurrence just sufficiently
common not to pass as unduly remarkable. Similarly the distances
ridden by raiders are fantastic. A hundred miles in the day have
been covered by a band of a few hard-pressed men. Individual
performances are even better. A messenger quite recently rode from
Agades to In Gall in one day and back the next on the same camel,
which therefore covered not less than one hundred and forty miles
as the crow flies in forty hours, and probably one hundred and
sixty by road. Another man, on a famous camel it is true, rode from
the River of Agades near Akaraq to Iferuan, a distance of not less
than one hundred and sixty miles, in just over twenty-four hours.
The two messengers who brought the news to Zinder in 1917, that the
post of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> Agades was
besieged, covered over four hundred kilometres in under four days.
And such instances could be multiplied. A raiding party, however,
will not usually average more than thirty-five miles a day, and
even so the hardship is considerable if this rate has to be kept up
for many days. The bands are often made up of more men than camels,
some of them in turn having to walk until they can loot more
mounts. The Tuareg on raids are generally well-behaved towards each
other. They do not kill unless the looted tribe or village puts up
a fight, for it is an unwritten law among them that on ordinary
raids, as opposed to real warfare, only live-stock is taken. Houses
are not destroyed and villages are not burnt. This forbearance is,
of course, largely due to the fact that there is nothing of any
weight worth removing, such wealth as the Tuareg possess being
principally in flocks and herds, of which only the camels can
readily be driven off. But secrecy is essential, and when,
therefore, a stray wanderer is met on the road who might give
warning of the arrival of a raiding party, he may be made to
accompany the robbers, or, if his presence is inconvenient, he may
have to be killed. The Tuareg do not capture each other as slaves
unless they are at war, though to steal someone’s slaves is, of
course, as legitimate as to steal his camels. Descents on French
patrols, posts, and tribes known to be engaged in assisting them
are considered legitimate, but they generally have had serious
consequences. For here more than raiding is involved—it is war. At
the end of last century raiding from Air was frequent: lifting
camels from the Aulimmiden had, in fact, become so common a pastime
that it was proscribed by the Holy Men, who decided that even
though no killing of Tuareg was taking place, the People of the
Veil should leave the People of the Veil alone and turn their
attentions to the Tebu, who were legitimate enemies. With the
latter the Air Tuareg neither give nor expect to receive mercy.
Raiding eastward at the end of last century became popular, but
fraught with more serious consequences. On one such<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> occasion the expedition turned
out so badly that Belkho’s own people, the Igermadan, after
successfully lifting camels and taking many prisoners in Kawar,
were virtually exterminated. They were surprised at night in their
over-confidence and massacred, a reverse from which the tribe to
this day has never recovered.</p>
<p>In his youth Ahodu accomplished some very successful raids in
the east. His greatest adventure was when he captured a big Arab
caravan bound from Murzuk to Bornu, some thirty years ago. He told
the story as follows, with Ali of Ghat sitting near him on the
floor of my hut. Now when a Tuareg tells a story he always draws on
the sand with his fingers to show the numbers of his camels and men
and the direction of his march, and when he counts in that way he
marks the units by little lines drawn with two or three fingers at
a time till he has reached ten, and then marks up a group of ten
with a single line to one side.</p>
<p>“That was nearly thirty years ago,” he said, and drew:</p>

<p>“First we found a group of camels, the ones we came for, half a
day on the Fashi side of Bilma. And some of the men went back with
them from here. They were afraid, but we went on. As I was the
leader I went too.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Then we had
news of a caravan of Arabs coming down the road from Murzuk, but my
men were afraid, for all the Arabs were supposed to have
rifles—they were only old stone guns [flint-locks]—and horses to
pursue us. We took counsel, and I agreed to go in and stampede the
horses, when my men would rush the caravan, which was camped in the
open under a dune. The dune had a little grass on it. [He then drew
a rough map of the battle-field on the sand.] So we hid for the
night behind another dune, and I crept in on the sleeping caravan
and lay still till dawn, behaving like a Tebu. In the cold before
dawn my men came up, but the Arabs saw them a little too soon and
the alarm spread. My men rushed the caravan all right, but one Arab
got away on his horse, barebacked, with a rifle, and nearly created
a panic among my men when he sat down to shoot at us from a hill.
He only fired two shots and they did no harm, but my men ran away
till I showed them that we had picked up the only other two guns of
the caravan. Then my men regained courage. We took two hundred
laden camels with ‘malti’ [cotton stuff], tea and sugar, and we
emptied even our waterskins to fill them with sugar, and still so
had to leave much on the ground.”</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ali.</span> “I was in Bornu then, waiting for
that caravan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> Ai!

<p><span class="sc">Ahodu.</span> “Yes (relapsing into silence);

<p><span class="sc">Self.</span> “Will you come on a raid with me

<p><span class="sc">Self.</span> “But where shall we go?—there are
no caravans now.”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ahodu.</span> “Never mind, there are some fine
female camels in Tibesti.”</p>
<p>It was their great sport and had its recognised rules. It kept
their men virile, but is finished now.</p>
<p>The essence of rapid travel by camel is lightness of equipment.
It is a mistake to suppose that the actual rate of progression on
camels is anything but very slow. It may come as a surprise to many
to learn that even riding camels rarely move out of a walk. They
say in the Sahara that it is bad for the camel to run. The riding
camels of the Tuareg are selected and tried beasts, but they are
never, in fact, trotted except for quite brief periods. The French
camel patrols, after many years of experience, are by regulation
forbidden to move out of a walk: the weight of equipment which they
have to carry may be a reason, but there must be more in it than
that, for even raiding parties follow the same practice. It is held
that the fatigue of man and beast consequent upon trotting is
disproportionate to the results achieved. But the walk of a camel
is slow at any time; to average 3·5 miles an hour over long
distances is very good going, while 2·5 with a baggage caravan is
all that can be managed.</p>
<p>Where the raider has the advantage over any organised military
body engaged in chasing him is in the lightness of his load. The
Tuareg camel saddle weighs a few pounds only; the head-rope or
bridle is a simple cord without trappings: a small skin of water, a
skin of dates, a rifle and perhaps twenty to thirty rounds of
ammunition are the only<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_194">[194]</span> serious additions to the rider’s own
weight. But long marches under these conditions are tiring, and
scarcely anyone not born to the saddle can survive ten to fourteen
hours’ riding day after day for hundreds of miles on a minimum
diet. It is the habit of the Tuareg, in Air and elsewhere as well,
when they start on such expeditions to procure a long length of
stuff woven in the Sudan and tie it round their bodies as support
for the abdomen, on which the motion of the camel imposes great
strain. In Air the stuff they use is rather like a bandage some
four inches wide, of unbleached and undyed cotton tissue; the
material is similar to that used for making up robes, for which
purpose numerous strips are sewn together and then dyed. These
strips of cotton stuff are wound several times tightly round the
waist and then over the shoulders, crossing on the breast and
back.<a id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class=
"fnanchor">[178]</a> The practice is particularly interesting,
because many of the Egyptian pictures of Libyans show the belt and
cross strapping. In referring to the dress of the Libyans, who are
often described as “cross-belted,” Bates<a id=
"FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class=
"fnanchor">[179]</a> has made a peculiarly apposite remark: “As
seen on the Egyptian monuments, the Libyan girdles were like some
modern polo belts cut broader in the back than in the front.” And
the Tuareg bandages serve identically the same purpose in similar
circumstances, namely, during periods of great physical strain on
the stomach muscles. On the analogy of the Tuareg practice, Bates
is right in supposing that the Libyan method of wearing the “belt”
was to pass it several times round the body: the end was then
pushed “down between the body and the girdle, and afterwards again
brought up and tucked in.”</p>
<p>To own camels, and yet more camels, is the ultimate ambition of
every Tuareg. A man may be rich in donkeys, goats or sheep, or he
may have houses, gardens and slaves, but camels are the coveted
possessions. Therein the nomadic<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_195">[195]</span> instinct obtrudes. When I found T’ekhmedin
at Towar, he possessed the few rags on his back, and a garden which
just kept him alive. He had no prospects of becoming richer; there
were no caravans to Ghat, by guiding which he might earn his fees:
the French he would not serve: his surplus garden produce had no
market. After I had known him a little while I gave him a white
cotton robe embroidered on the breast, of the fashion worn by the
Hausa, but not favoured in Air. One day not long afterwards I met
him and noticed that he was in his old rags once more. He became
confused and avoided me. He eventually begged my excuses and hoped
that I would not be hurt; he had sold the robe I had given him to
the Sultan of Agades, who had found the Southland fashion more to
his taste than a true Imajegh would have done. With the proceeds of
this deal, T’ekhmedin had bought a half-share in a young camel
which had gone to Bilma in charge of a friend with the great
caravan to fetch a load of salt. He became more cheerful as he
explained. In a few weeks if all went well he expected to have
enough money to buy a small camel of his own, and so build up his
fortune once more. He nearly wept with gratitude when he had done
telling his story. It seemed, I had been the means of
rehabilitating him in the world of men, a prospect which appeared
only a short time before to be beyond the range of possibility.</p>

<p>To a European all camels at first look much the same, but a few
weeks’ association with them enables one rapidly to differentiate
between the different breeds. They vary as much in build as they do
in colour. Camels of almost every African and some Arabian
varieties may, sooner or later, be seen in Air, but only two
varieties properly belong to the country or to the Tuareg of these
parts. The tall, sandy-fawn-coloured Tibesti camel, standing an
immense height at the shoulder, is much prized; the Ghati camel,
reddish-fawn in colour, is fairly common. The latter is
short-legged with heavy stubby bones and big foot-pads; he has a
straight back, holds his head low, and is capable<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> of carrying immense loads over
sandy country, but at a slower pace than the Tebu animal, which is
generally more of the riding build. The western camel of Timbuctoo
is represented by an animal with a well-arched back, generally
lighter-limbed and more graceful than the Ghati sort. The Ahaggar
camel is recognisable by his great height and strength, and above
all by his very shaggy coat with a long beard and fluffy shoulders:
he is usually dark in colour. The Maghrabi camel also has very
hairy shoulders, the colour varying from red-fawn to very dark
brown. The two types of camels belonging to the Air Tuareg are both
very distinctive. There is a great white camel and a smaller grey
or piebald animal. The white camel is said originally to have
belonged to the Kel Geres, to have been specially bred and brought
by them originally to the Southland. He has long flat withers and a
round hump; but either because the Kel Geres in recent years have
lived in the Southland, or for some other reason connected with
their original habitat, the white camel is a plain land animal and
is almost useless on rocky ground. He is consequently not very
highly valued in Air.</p>
<p>The true Air camel is very peculiar. The species may be divided
into two categories, the grey and the piebald, the latter being
perhaps derived from a cross between the former and some other
breed. The Air grey is a sturdy and straight-backed animal with
sloping quarters and a long neck, which he holds rather low. He can
carry a fair load and negotiate any sort of ground. The colour
varies from iron-grey to brown-ash and is quite distinctive; the
coat is either uniform or speckled. Although the Tuareg say that
the original stock is the piebald, the pure-bred animal apparently
has a uniform coat. The “type animal” is called the Tegama camel,
the iron-grey colour is known as “ifurfurzan.” In the
parti-coloured animal the markings take the form of large patches
of dark grey and white with sharp edges, as if the skin had been
painted, or of small patches giving a dappled appearance, or of a
combination of the two, or, more rarely, of undefined patches
merging into one another. Inter-breeding has produced the
red-fawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> and white,
and the brown and white animals. Though very sturdy, they are
light-boned and small-footed, but their short legs and short
sloping withers give them an agility which is quite unbelievable in
what the world has always regarded as an ungainly animal. The eyes
of these camels are sometimes pale blue and white, a peculiarity
which makes them look very strange. The breed is much prized as a
curiosity or freak outside Air.</p>
<p>Temajegh, like Arabic, has innumerable names for various types
of camels. The most valuable animal is the cow-camel which has
calved once; they are not used more than can be helped for long or
very strenuous work, because they are, on the whole, not so strong
as the males. They are rested as much as possible prior to, and
after, calving. If a cow-camel has calved on the road it is common
to see the small calf carried on the mother’s back until it is fit
to run alongside, which is within two or three days. Stud fees are
unknown: attempts are made as far as possible to avoid
cross-breeding. A certain Ahmadu of the Kel Tagei is known
throughout Air as the possessor of the finest herd of pure Tegama
cow-camels in the mountains: they are maintained exclusively for
breeding purposes. These are some of the commonest Temajegh names
used in Air:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Camels are
curiously delicate animals, as anyone who has had anything to do
with them will know to his cost. They lose condition very quickly
and mysteriously, and do not regain it easily. Camel travelling
implies a perpetual fruitless attempt to maintain their condition
by seeking to reconcile progress and pasturing. The ideal is to
give the beasts at least four hours’ grazing, which must not be at
night or in the heat of the day, when the camel is prone to rest in
the shade of a tree instead of feeding. At the same time, when it
is very hot it is neither good for man nor beast to march; nor
should the camel march all night either, when four hours’ rest are
very desirable. Lastly, it must be remembered that it is tiring for
camels to be on and off loaded more than once a day, since every
time they kneel or get up with a heavy burden they are subjected to
a considerable strain; it is consequently inadvisable to divide a
march into two parts. To reach a satisfactory compromise is
difficult. So long as not more than about twenty miles a day are
being covered, any system works well enough, but where long marches
are necessary there is no really satisfactory solution. The Tuareg
himself usually starts late in the morning and marches till dusk,
when he off-loads; he then drives his camels to pasture, leaving
them out all night; they are slowly collected after dawn, when they
have again begun to feed. The disadvantage from the European point
of view is that there is always some delay in finding the camels in
the morning, as one or two are sure to have strayed, nor is it
always safe to leave camels wandering about unguarded at night. The
French Camel Corps patrols and other Europeans usually prefer to
start in the night and march until high noon or the early
afternoon. I have myself tried every course, and with all its
disadvantages finally adopted the Tuareg system. To these
complications must be added the consideration that if a camel is
watered it should be at noon, when the sun is hot, in order to make
him drink well. If there is no reason to anticipate long waterless
journeys, camels are watered every third day, but if they
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> required to
cross difficult tracts of desert, the intervals must gradually be
increased beforehand. Above all, the camel must be made really
thirsty prior to his final drink before the longest waterless
portion of the journey is attempted. The camel must start almost
bursting with the water in his belly.</p>
<p>It is generally more important for a camel not to miss a day’s
pasture than a day’s water. When the rains have fallen and green
vegetation is abundant, camels need not be watered for long
intervals. If they are not being worked they can go for weeks
without drinking. Camels will eat anything if put to it, from hard
grass with a straw like wire to any kind of tree or shrub; acacia
thorns three and four inches long appear to make no difference to
his digestion. Pasture is the most important factor on the march,
for the animal is really a fastidious feeder and requires plenty of
variety.</p>
<p>The woes which afflict the camel are numerous. First and worst
are saddle sores, which rapidly become stinking and gangrenous.
They develop quickly from a slight rub or gall under the saddle,
and often end by infecting the bones of the spine or ribs. They
discharge a thick offensive pus either through the sore or under
the skin. In treating them the first thing to do is to open the
wound and let the pus escape, after which the best cure, I found as
others have discovered, is to wash the wound with a strong solution
of permanganate of potash. Thereafter an iodoform dressing is
almost miraculous in its quick-healing properties, as it keeps away
the flies, and consequently obviates maggots and re-infection. The
great black crows in Air have an odious habit of sitting on the
backs of camels and pecking at these sores. They do terrible damage
with their long powerful beaks. The only way to keep them off is to
tie a pair of crow’s wings to the hair on the hump of the camel.
The remedy is sovereign, as I learnt by experience, but I am at a
loss to explain the psychological process governing the action of
the live crows which are thus scared away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Apart from
deaths due to eating poisonous plants, which are far more numerous
in the Southland than in Air, the highest mortality among camels in
Air comes from a disease known locally as “blood in the head.” It
is a form of pernicious apoplexy or congestion of blood in the
head. The early symptoms are hard to observe unless one happens to
be born a Tuareg. As the attack develops the camel becomes dazed
and lies in the sun with rather a glassy stare, instead of feeding.
Later it runs about, hitting its head against trees, and finally
falls to the ground in contortions, dying very rapidly of a stroke.
The disease is especially common after the rains, when the pasture
is rich or when the animals are idle, recovering condition. If they
are left in the Southland for the whole year, the rich feeding
there aggravates the incidence of the disease. An attack may be
staved off by the remedy, which is also used for dealing with
refractory animals, namely, of putting tobacco snuff in their eyes.
This apparently cruel treatment is singularly efficacious, and I
can only suppose that the irritation or smarting has the effect of
a stimulant which draws or dispels the blood pressure. When the
disease is more advanced, resort has to be had to blood-letting;
the jugular artery is cut a span below the left ear and blood is
drawn to an amount which will fill three cup-shaped hollows in the
ground made by removing a double handful of sand or earth from
each. The blood is seen at first to flow very dark in colour; as it
gradually resumes its normal hue, the hæmorrhage is stopped by
taking a tuft of hair, dipping it into the coagulated blood and
inserting it in the cut. As soon as a clot is formed the incision
is covered with sand. The whole proceeding sounds a fantastically
imprudent and septic way of dealing with an arterial hæmorrhage,
but it works most successfully. If camels are sickening for
disease, and especially for “blood in the head,” which may
sometimes be recognised by the premonitory symptom of very hard,
dry droppings, they are dosed with a mixture made of tobacco leaf,
onion, and the seed of grain called “Araruf,” containing a
pungent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> oil
apparently of the mustard variety. These ingredients are pounded
up, mixed with about a gallon of water and poured down the camel’s
throat.</p>
<p>Firing is resorted to for various ills, especially around bad
sores to prevent them from spreading and to induce healing. A cow
is very often fired across the flanks after calving, when she is
also given a goatskin-full of millet and water “to fill up the
empty space in her belly.” Firing round the breast pad is carried
out when the animal is suffering from the disease which causes the
pad to split. Mange is fairly frequent, and is treated with a
mixture of oil and ashes. The worst disease of all is called
“Tara,” for which there is said to be no cure: the symptoms are a
wasting of the legs, and eventual death from debility and breakage
of the bones: luckily I had no experience of the malady, which is
said to be infectious or contagious. The Tuareg say that there is
no reason for its coming, but that Allah sometimes unaccountably
sends it.</p>
<p>The Tuareg empiric remedies, other than those described, are not
interesting except in their treatment of gangrenous wounds. When
they have washed the wound with a lotion of female camel urine or
brewed from one of several plants which seem to have remarkably
little effect, they cover the exposed flesh with a powder of
crumbled donkey droppings dried in the sun. I was appalled at the
danger of septic infection when I first saw the practice, but soon
discovered that the powder, which had, I supposed, become
sterilised in the sun, was a really effectual method of preventing
the great harm caused by flies settling on the wound. I can now
confidently recommend this practice.</p>
<p>Camels, of course, are branded with tribal marks, a complete
study of which would be worth making. Each mark has its own name,
and many of them are derived from certain known symbols or perhaps
letters, all of which call for investigation in connection with
marks from other parts of Africa. Some of the principal brands in
Air are given in <a href="#i21">Plate 21,</a> the most interesting
being the mark of the Ghati<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_202">[202]</span> Tuareg (Azger); it is called the Hatita,
after the name of the famous leader of Barth’s day.</p>
<p>This necessarily brief note on the animal which is so intimately
bound up with the life of the People of the Veil, not to say their
very existence, may be supplemented by some mention of the other
domestic animals of Air.</p>
<p>In Nigeria the best horses are described as Asben horses; yet in
Air there is hardly a horse to be seen. The explanation is
presumably that the Tuareg bring, or used to bring, the best horses
for sale in Hausaland; but they were not necessarily bred in Air.
The supposition is reasonable, for the Tuareg north of Sokoto, and
especially the Aulimmiden, west of Air, possess a number of horses
which are renowned for their hardiness, and of course all Tuareg in
the Southland are called Asbenawa. In Air the best of the few
horses are, with an even lesser show of logic, described as Bagezan
horses; but there are no horses in the mountains. The tracks are
far too rough for there ever at any time to have been a
considerable number of horses in the hills. I can offer no
explanation of the name. Air is not a horse-breeding country. The
pasture is too rough even after the rains, while during the dry
season the only green stuff is on the trees, which, even if it were
good fodder for horses, could only be reached by animals of the
build of camels. The few horses which I saw in Air belonged to the
Sultan at Agades and to the Añastafidet. They were small and wiry
but rather nondescript, a variable cross of Arab and Sudanese
blood; in no case could they be said to represent an “Air breed.”
The Tuareg say the horse came to Air from the north, and in point
of fact all those I saw bore a certain resemblance to the little
animals of Tripolitania. There are probably not more than 100
horses in Air altogether to-day. Water is far too scarce a
commodity for horses to be much used for travelling. Those in the
mountains are never watered more than once a day, and can easily do
three days between drinking without undue fatigue.</p>
<p>The other domestic animals are donkeys, cattle,
sheep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> goats, dogs
and a few Hausa cats. Falconry is not a pastime in Air. The cattle
come from the south; they are of the humped and ordinary varieties.
The bulls are used for drawing water from the garden irrigation
wells; cows are more scarce. Before the war the Tuareg used to
carry on an active trade in cattle, buying from the Fulani in
Damergu and selling to the people of Ghat and the Fezzan.
Incredible as it may seem, cattle used to be driven over the roads
to Ghat after the rains, and do as much as four and five days
without water. The mortality must have been considerable, but their
cheapness in the Southland made the trade profitable. It is curious
how all the animals in Air, including man, seem to get used to
going without water for long periods. Oxen are used to a certain
extent as pack animals both in Air and Damergu; Barth started his
journey from Northern Air to Agades on an ox; he considered this
mount indifferent as a means of transport, for he fell off and
nearly broke his compass. The association of cattle with a
well-watered country where they can drink every day must be
dismissed in the Sahara, and this disposes of one of the
difficulties surrounding the problem of the ox-drawn chariots of
the Garamantes which so exercised Duveyrier;<a id=
"FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class=
"fnanchor">[181]</a> loaded oxen can march comfortably with water
only every third day.</p>
<p>The donkey is very nearly as good a performer in the desert as
the camel. In austerity of diet he is better, being less fastidious
about pasture and quite as capable of doing four and five days in
cold weather, between wells. But his pace is even slower than that
of the camel, and his maximum load should not exceed 100 lbs.
Curiously enough, donkeys suffer from the same disease as camels
after the rains: they get “blood in the head,” but in their case a
treatment of snuff in the eyes is said to be useless. They have to
be bled by making an incision with a curious bent iron instrument
in the roof of the mouth above the lower molars. The operation
looks ridiculous, but the donkey is always a humorous beast. The
ones in Air and nearly all those in the Southland<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> are small grey animals,
standing not more than four feet from the ground, with straight
knife-edged backs. I saw none of the large white donkeys of Egypt.
Near T’imia and in the north-eastern parts of Air there are a
number of wild donkeys, roaming unbroken and unherded. They are the
descendants of domestic donkeys driven out to propagate and find
their own livelihood by certain tribes who claim them when captured
in their own areas. These animals, like the gazelle of the country,
exist on pasture alone, for they often encounter no open water to
drink for ten months of the year.</p>
<p>The commonest domestic animals are the sheep and goats. Every
village and tribe has large herds. After the camels they constitute
the principal wealth of the people and do exceedingly well. The
sheep are all of the gaunt wire-haired variety without woollen
fleeces, resembling goats. The latter provide most of the milk in
the villages, and vary in colour from white to black, with every
intermediate shade of brown and type of marking. Curiously enough,
none of the Tuareg of Air, and, I believe, none of the other
groups, either spin the hair of goats or the wool of their own
camels. A good sheep in 1922 could be bought for six to seven and a
goat for four to five silver francs. Camels ranged between £5 and
£12 a head.</p>
<p>The number of domestic animals in Air, hard and barren as the
country seems to be, is surprisingly large. In a rough classifying
census of the Tuareg of Air, including only a few tribes in the
Southland and not counting either the Kel Geres or Aulimmiden,
Jean<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class=

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>The figures in
Column II are Chudeau’s<a id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> estimate of 1909, while
those in Column III were compiled by another authority: those in
Column IV are my present estimate. There is little doubt that the
number of camels in Air before the war was grossly under-estimated
by the early authorities. From fear of taxation and requisition the
Tuareg will resort to every device to conceal their possessions,
and especially the number of their camels. The same applies to
their sheep and goats. In 1913 the number of camels in Air was put
down at 60,000, which then was probably a reasonable figure. The
herds were seriously depleted by the requisitions made for the
expeditions of 1913-14 to Tibesti, when not less than 23,000 camels
were taken, few of which ever returned to the country. This was
certainly one of the principal grievances which led to the 1917
revolution. During the operations of 1917-18 the herds were further
diminished, and have only recently again begun to increase at a
rate which is bound to be slow when it is realised that a camel
cannot be worked at all till it is over three years old, and ought
not to be worked till it is five, while from seven years onward it
is at its prime for only about five years. Nowadays there are
probably not more than about 25,000 camels in Air; the sheep and
goats, however, have once more reached their pre-war figure, which
must have been nearly half a million.<a id=
"FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class=
"fnanchor">[184]</a></p>
<p>The last domestic animals worth mentioning are the dogs, of a
type usually resembling inferior Arabian gazelle hounds, with short
hair, often brown in colour, or with the brown or liver-and-white
markings like foxhounds. The “pi” dog, which is so common in the
north of Africa, I never saw in Air. Dogs are interesting owing to
the friendly way in which they are treated by the Tuareg; they are
much more the companions of man than is usual among Moslems,
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> characteristic
which has probably survived from pre-Moslem days. Duveyrier refers
to three types of dog among the Tuareg: a greyhound
(<em>lévrier</em>), a long-haired Arab dog which is very rare, and
a short-haired cross from these two. The latter appears to be the
domestic dog in Air.<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p>Chickens are common and are eaten. In this the southern Tuareg
differ from the Tuareg of the north, among whom Duveyrier
specifically states that chickens, other birds and eggs are
prohibited as food.<a id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186"
class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>
<p>But all domestic animals sink into insignificance in comparison
with the camel, whose rôle is so outstanding in the nomadic life of
the Tuareg that one wonders how the inhabitants of the Sahara can
have lived before the advent of this animal, which is usually
supposed to have come from the East at a comparatively late date in
history.</p>
<p>The camel in Africa offers a most interesting historical problem
around which there has been much inconclusive scientific dispute.
The camel does not appear on Egyptian monuments before the Saitic
period, and is not mentioned as living in Africa either by
Herodotus or by Sallust, when the horse and probably the donkey
were the ordinary means of transport of the nomads. It is fairly
clear that the Carthaginians did not use camels, or we should
certainly have found some reference to the animal in the accounts
of the Punic or Jugurthine wars. It is said by so eminent an
authority as Basset<a id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187"
class="fnanchor">[187]</a> that none of the Berber dialects contain
any names for the camel which cannot be traced to Arabic origins,
but this generalisation is also disputed. Sallust<a id=
"FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class=
"fnanchor">[188]</a> says the Romans first saw a camel when they
fought Mithridates at Rhyndacus, but Plutarch says it was at the
battle of Magnesia in <em>c.</em> 190 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
The first text mentioning camels in Africa is in the account of the
fighting with Juba, when Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> captured twenty-two on
the Zeta. A camel figures<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_207">[207]</span> on a coin attributed either to L. Lollius
Palicanus, a prefect of Cyrenaica under Augustus, or alternatively
to L. Lollius, a lieutenant of Pompey,<a id=
"FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class=
"fnanchor">[190]</a> but the first mention of camels in any large
numbers is during the Empire, when in the late fourth century
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> the general Romanus requisitioned
4000 animals for transport purposes from the inhabitants of Leptis
Magna.<a id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class=
"fnanchor">[191]</a> Other sources, including sculptures and texts
of this period from now on, confirm their frequency, and by the
time Corippus was writing the camel was the normal means of
transport in the interior. The silence of Pliny<a id=
"FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class=
"fnanchor">[192]</a> the Elder is valuable, if negative, evidence
for Africa, as he mentions camels in Bactria and Arabia, and speaks
of the East as the home of this animal. He knows nothing of them
apparently in Africa. It is on such evidence that it has been
supposed that camels were first introduced into Cyrenaica<a id=
"FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class=
"fnanchor">[193]</a> from Sinai and Arabia. The conclusion would be
more readily acceptable were it not for the unfortunate discoveries
of camel skeletons associated with evidence of human industry of
the Pleistocene period in more than one palæolithic site in North
Africa.<a id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class=
"fnanchor">[194]</a> In rock drawings the camel, of course, figures
largely; these glyphs may not be of extreme antiquity, but they are
quite possibly prior to the earliest classical references. It has
been said that in really early rock drawings the camel is not
represented, but neither has any complete catalogue of the drawings
yet been made, nor has any conclusive scheme of dating been
compiled. The question remains undecided, for although the camel
was rare on the coast in early historical times, there is no
evidence that it was not used more extensively in the interior. It
is difficult consequently to discuss the question of early
transport methods in the Sahara, of which I would only say that
conditions of water supply have apparently for several
thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> years been
much as they certainly were throughout historical and modern times.
An interesting theory has lately been advanced that there is an
African and an Eastern species of camel distinguished by the
peculiarity that some camels have one and some two canine teeth on
each side of the upper jaw.</p>
<p>In the absence of any conclusive evidence it is safest to
assume, as do most authorities, that the camel was not common in
North Africa till as late as the second century <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span></p>
<p>Gsell<a id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class=
"fnanchor">[195]</a> makes an interesting suggestion that “La
prospérité de la Tripolitaine prit certainement un grand essor sous
la dynastie des Sévères, dont le chef était originaire de Leptis
Magna. Ce fut à cette époque que Rome mit des garnisons dans les
oases situées sur les routes du Soudan, ce qui favorisa évidemment
le commerce des caravanes. Peut-être le développement du trafic
trans-saharien fit alors adopter définitivement l’usage du
chameau.” The problem of what transport was used before this period
is only in part answered by Herodotus,<a id=
"FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class=
"fnanchor">[196]</a> who tells us that the Garamantes harnessed
oxen to carts, a statement which is confirmed from other sources,
which add that cattle were used as beasts of burden as well.
Whether wheeled vehicles ever reached Air is doubtful,<a id=
"FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class=
"fnanchor">[197]</a> but the use of the pack-ox there continues as
it does in the south. Whatever the means of transport which they
favoured in their original northern homes, the Tuareg were already
using camels when they reached Air. Dissociation of the Tuareg from
his camel is difficult to conceive, since his life to-day as a
nomad is so intimately bound up with the animal, which in turn has
served so strongly to maintain his nomadic instinct. Of all animals
it alone enables the Tuareg to remain to a great extent independent
of his physical surroundings. Neither oxen nor donkeys could do so
to the same extent.</p>
<p>The historical and anthropological aspect of the introduction of
the ox and camel into Africa, and the identification<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> of the races with which these
animals were associated, are questions which concern the general
story of North Africa rather than that of the Tuareg in particular.
Fundamentally the Tuareg remains the pure nomad even when his
habitat has changed and circumstances have obliged him to settle in
villages or on the land. In Air all the truest nomads inhabit the
Talak plain and the N.W. of the plateau, with the one great
exception of the Ifadyen tribe, which during the last generation
has moved south to Azawagh and Tegama. The true nomads have no
fixed centres of permanent habitation whatsoever, thereby differing
considerably from many of the purest Arabian nomads. But, unlike
the latter again, they do not migrate very far afield; their winter
and summer pastures are usually not very distant from each other.
The only exception that I know to this rule is the case of some of
the Ahaggaren, who send their herds to graze as far afield as the
Adghar n’Ifoghas<a id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198"
class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and at times Damergu.<a id=

<p>For many months of the year after the rains the true nomads do
not even trouble to cluster round a group of wells; living on the
milk of their camels and goats, they dispense with water for weeks
on end. So long as their camels are only pasturing and the fodder
is green they do not require to be watered. They are therefore able
to live many days from the nearest wells. In such conditions water
is a luxury, for it entails long marches and is not essential to
man or beast. In South-eastern Air I came across a small party of
Kel Takrizat, who had wandered some distance away from their usual
grounds in North-western Air, to an area which had been uninhabited
since the war. I was riding out from Tabello on the upper Beughqot
valley to look for an old village site of which I had heard.
Neither my companion, Alwali, nor I had any baggage, and we were
short of water, as the skin I carried was leaky. For a mere two
days’ journey Alwali had not thought it worth while<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> to bring any food for himself
except a small skin of millet meal milk, which he had finished
early the first afternoon. In the evening we entered a wide valley
known as Tsabba,<a id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200"
class="fnanchor">[200]</a> where we saw a number of camels
pasturing. We discovered that they belonged to a charming man
called Ahmadu ag Musa. The valley was about miles broad from lip to
lip, very green and full of a veitch-like plant called “Alwat,”
which contains much moisture. The bottom under the steep sides lay
some 100 feet below the level of the plain, which was covered with
round basalt boulders wherever there were not hillocks of bare rock
rising above it. It is a very arid country looking out towards the
Eastern Desert, where the last rocks of Air are swallowed up in
sand some thirty miles further on. Ahmadu’s camp consisted of a few
mats spread under two or three little trees. As we reached it he
came out to meet us. When he found out who we were, he asked me to
spend the night with him; and this, having at the time intermittent
fever which was due that evening, I willingly agreed to do,
provided he could let me have some water. He regretted that he had
no water, as he had not been near a well for three weeks, but his
men went to fetch milk. I had barely dismounted and agreed to stay
when a man ran up with a mat for me to sit on and a bowl of sour
milk to drink. Among the Tuareg, if a man comes as a guest his host
is personally responsible for his guest’s life, camels and
property, so a slave unsaddled my two camels and hobbled them in
the usual way by tying the two fore fetlocks together with the
short hobble rope which everyone carries. My animals were driven
off to feed with Ahmadu’s herd of piebald cow camels. I thought at
first it was part of the famous Tegama herd of Ahmadu of the Kel
Tagei, but it turned out to be another Ahmadu.</p>
<p>I met him only that once, and for a few moments two days later
at Tabello. I have the pleasantest recollections of a great
gentleman. We sat talking of the impending departure of the salt
caravan for Bilma. The sun set slowly, and, as the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> light grew less, the cruel
gleam left the basalt and granite of the plateau beyond the eastern
lip of the valley. The rocks ceased to look metallic in the dance
of the hot air, and became soft red and purple in the green-blue
sky. Here and there white sand from the outer desert had been
washed up against the hillocks. Mount Gorset, with one slope
inundated by the sand flood, lay just north of the valley where we
sat surrounded by acacia bushes and “Alwat.” The wind had fallen.
More and more food was brought for us to eat, all of it of the sort
on which the true nomad lives. Cheese, sweet and sour milk, curdled
milk, whey water, some cakes of baked burr-grass seed and a very
little millet. We sat down to eat; they thought I wanted to eat
alone at first, but became more friendly when they saw that some
white men were only human like themselves. A pot of cooked millet
meal was set down in the middle; luckily they had added salt to the
porridge. Each man in turn ate a mouthful from the big wooden spoon
and handed it on to his neighbour. I ate little, having fever, but
drank much milk, both sweet and sour. The former arrived during the
meal, warm and fresh from the camel. It is best quite fresh; when
it gets cold in the night it is good too, but becomes rather salt
and thin to the taste. We went on eating slowly in the evening, and
suddenly night came with a greenish light in the west behind our
backs. Milk was left for me to drink during the night; a slave was
told to fill my skin with millet meal and milk for the next day. We
went on talking, and then the snuff-box was passed round. The
Tuareg in Air do not smoke: their only vice, in the austere life
they lead, is to take snuff, when they can get it, or to chew green
tobacco mixed with a little saltpetre to bring out the taste. The
tobacco and snuff are traded from the Southland: the saltpetre is
found in Air, and is also used in cooking, for they say that a
pinch in the stew-pot makes the meat cook in half the usual time.
Presently I turned over to go to sleep on Ahmadu’s mat, in a
blanket which I had brought. He and Alwali went on talking far into
the night, for they were old friends: Alwali had travelled with him
when he was a boy many years ago.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>I thought of how
very happy these nomads were. They have no possessions to speak of:
a few mats, the clothes they wear, some water-skins, some camel
trappings, a few weapons, some gourds and bowls, a cooking-pot or
two and their camels. They have no routine of life, and no cares
except to wonder if a raiding party will or will not happen on
them. Even in their normal centres where their tribes are living
more or less permanently they often have neither tents nor
covering. At the best their tent is a leather roof made of two or
three ox skins carried on a few poles, with brushwood laid across
so that the top is dome-shaped. The sides are enclosed with
vertical mats, and inside, if they are rich, they have a bed—two
poles supported on four forked sticks stuck in the ground, with six
transverse poles overlaid with stiff mats, woven of “Afaza” grass
and strips of leather. On this bed, which is perhaps eight feet
square, the whole family sleeps during the rains. At other times
they sleep anywhere, on a mat on the ground. Their smaller
possessions are carried in a leather sack of tanned goatskins, dyed
and ornamented with fringes. All the belongings of a rich family
could be loaded on one, certainly on two camels. So they move about
looking for pasture. They are independent of water; their camels
and goats provide both food and drink, the grasses of the field a
change of diet; a slaughtered sheep or millet porridge is their
luxury. When they want a fire they kindle it by rubbing a small
green stick cut about the size of, and sharpened like, a pencil on
a dry stick; the dust and fibre rubbed off the dry wood collect at
one end of the channel which has been rubbed, and when the friction
is enough, ignites. They do not even require flint and steel. I am
sure they must be very happy, for they want so little and could
have so much when the value of their herds often runs into
thousands of pounds, but they prefer the freedom of the open world.
They are even envied by the village dwellers, whose sole ambition
is to make enough money to buy camels and live in the same way as
their wandering kinsmen.</p>

<p class="sch">TRADE AND OCCUPATIONS</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> Auderas country, still almost in
Tegama, is far less interesting ethnically than the north or east.
The old permanent habitations in the area are less characteristic
of the Tuareg; there are hardly any inscriptions or rock drawings,
with the exception of the large group at T’in Wana, and a few
scattered about elsewhere. Owing to the many pools and
“eresan”<a id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class=
"fnanchor">[201]</a> there are no deep wells. At Auderas itself
there are some ruined stone-built dwellings of the later type, but
a few earlier examples may be seen both there and at Abattul, a
village about two miles to the N.E. in the same basin of valleys. A
famous mosque was founded there by Muhammad Abd el Kerim el
Baghdadi. Abattul village lies between the domed peaks of
Faken<a id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class=
"fnanchor">[202]</a> and Mt. Abattul, which is itself a spur of
Mount Todra. Behind, and between them, a valley and rough track run
north to Mount Dogam. Just south of the village are the valleys
which converge from Todra and Faken on the main Auderas basin. From
Auderas Mount Faken is a prominent object on the northern horizon
with a rounded top and vertical black sides which look unscalable.
Almost at the foot of Faken on the Abattul side is a pool in a deep
gorge, usually containing water enough to swim in most of the year.
The path from Auderas to Abattul is very rough, as it crosses and
re-crosses several small valleys where gazelle, some wild pig, and
occasionally monkeys are to be found. Abattul village lies just
under a low white cliff in which there are a few caves and many
smaller holes inhabited by owls and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214">[214]</span> night birds. It was the first settlement in
the basin and was only gradually abandoned as the country became
less subject to raids and war. The inhabitants had settled in this
place so that they could easily take refuge in the inaccessible
crags of Mount Todra just behind their village, in time of raids.
Even nowadays the folk from Auderas have to resort to the mountain
from time to time, but not so often as to prevent them from living
further away. The stone mosque at Abattul is one of the few in Air
which is still used for prayer.<a id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>
<p>The main road from Auderas to Northern Air runs over very rocky
ground to a plain west of Faken, bordered by two valleys on the
east and by low hills on the west side. The latter continue for
some distance along the valley of Auderas until it eventually
reaches the foothills of Air on the Talak plain. The different
groups of hills are known by names which the Itesan sub-tribes
adopted and retained.<a id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The plain north of
Agades is the Erarar n’Dendemu of Barth:<a id=
"FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class=
"fnanchor">[205]</a> it contains El Baghdadi’s place of prayer
mentioned by the traveller, lying under a small hill. Turning left
here into more broken country by a small tributary the track enters
the Ighaghrar valley, which descends from the Gissat and T’Sidderak
hills.<a id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class=
"fnanchor">[206]</a></p>
<p>At the head of the basin a steep drop leads into a valley
flowing north between Mount Bila to the west and Mount Dogam to the
east. This drop, the descent of Inzerak, is equivalent to the
ascent south of Auderas at T’inien on to the central platform of
the plateau. It leads into one of the most beautiful valleys in
Air, called Assada, the head of which, at right angles to its main
direction, is formed by small ravines draining Mount Dogam. It runs
along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> eastern
foot of Bila and falls into Anu Maqaran, the central basin of Air.
When we came into Assada there were two or three pools near the
foot of Inzerak; further up the T’ighummar tributary lay a small
village of stone houses with a deep well and mosque on an
alternative loop road from Auderas branching off at the place of
prayer of El Baghdadi. This alternative track was the one taken by
Barth in 1850; it debouches into the Tegidda valley, a tributary of
the Assada from the north, at Aureran well.</p>
<p>I camped in Assada three times in all, twice near the foot of
the descent and once a mile or so further down at the wells of
Tamenzaret,<a id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class=
"fnanchor">[207]</a> which are temporary and require to be dug
again every year. The deep narrow valley with its sandy bed and
immense trees growing in the thick vegetation on both banks was
magnificent. Towering up on either side the red mountains framed,
in a cleft towards the east, the cone of Dogam seated on a pedestal
of black lava and basalt. Most of the Dogam massif is so rough as
to be impassable. It seems to be a volcanic intrusion in the Todra
group, to which it really belongs. I suspect that the basalt
boulders covering the plain north and south of Auderas, and perhaps
certain features of Todra itself, owe their origin to the Dogam
activity. But Bila is hardly less imposing: on the Assada side it
presents a wall of vivid red rock. The fine clean colours of dawn
on the first morning I saw the mountains against a cold blue sky
offered the most lovely spectacle I saw in all Air.</p>
<p>The Assada and T’ighummar valleys are inhabited by a northern
section of the Kel Nugguru, who pasture their goats and camels
there, and owe allegiance to Ahodu of Auderas. There are a few
ruined stone houses below Tamenzaret and the remains of a mosque at
the old deep well of Aureran, where the main road divides. From
here one branch proceeds north past another ruined settlement to
the Arwa Mellen valley and mountain, the other turns east towards
the upper part of the Anu Maqaran basin.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_216">[216]</span> I took the latter road to T’imia. It
crossed several broad valley beds flowing northwards from Dogam,
notably the Bacos, where there is a village and palm grove, and the
Elazzas not far from where they fall into Anu Maqaran. The road I
have had occasion to mention as running from Agades by the Ara
valley over the shoulder of Dogam descends from the Central massif
by Bacos or Elazzas. The latter corresponds to the Ara on the other
side of the Dogam pass. By these two the Todra-Dogam group is
divided from Bagezan.</p>
<p>Near its junction with the main Anu Maqaran valley, the Elazzas
is a broad bed between low rocky banks. At a certain point where it
crosses a ridge of rock large quantities of water are held up in
the sand. The remains of a recent village with a few date palms
appear on the site. The rocks in the neighbourhood bear a few rude
pictures, but the ruins, a few round pedestal foundations of loose
stones some 15-20 feet in diameter and 2-3 feet high, on which reed
huts used to stand, are uninteresting. Bila from here has the
appearance of a long flat ridge, in pleasant contrast to the
isolated peaks of Aggata and Arwa in the north, or the confused
mass of Bagezan to the south and south-east.</p>
<p>The upper part of the Anu Maqaran valley where the Bagezan and
the Agalak mountains at the western side of the T’imia massif
approach one another is called Abarakan. The road passes a large
cemetery and the valley narrows between high hills with bare sides
until a big fork is reached: one valley goes north to T’imia
village, the other south, emerging on the central plateau east of
the Bagezan mountains.</p>
<p>T’imia village is a veritable mountain fastness. The
Agalak-T’imia massif was evidently highly volcanic, for a great
flow of basalt overlying pink granite boulders has taken place
along the valley towards Abarakan. The track climbs steadily over
the broken lava stream. The going is rough. Then suddenly the track
seems to end altogether below an overhanging cliff of lava some 30
feet high lying right across the bed of the ravine. We reached this
point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> and found the
men of T’imia had come down to meet us in order to help our camels
to negotiate the path which follows a narrow crevasse in one side
of the cliff. The cleft is so narrow that a camel with a bulky load
cannot pass at all; it is so steep that the poor animals were
forced to proceed in a series of ungainly lurches or jumps. Above
the cliff the valley broadens out again, and where two small side
valleys enter it lies the modern village of T’imia.</p>

<p>This settlement of Kel Owi nobles is very different from the
servile Auderas. The parentage of these Kel Owi may be obscure and
mixed, but their physique, the general cleanliness of the place and
the neatness of their domed huts stamp them as nobles. The
dwellings stand grouped in compounds, or sometimes as single huts,
scattered between a row of gardens with irrigation wells, and the
slope of a hill covered with huge boulders. In one of the smaller
side valleys is a large grove of date palms with most of the
gardens, near the site of the older village, a collection of
rectangular masonry houses in ruins, and round hut sites marked by
a ring of stones and a hearth. The little mosque of stone and mud
construction lies between the old and new villages, but it was
desecrated by the French soldiers and is no longer used. A matting
shelter and compound in the new settlement serve to-day both for a
place of prayer and a school, presided over by the ’alim ’Umbellu.
Though over sixty he still works daily in his garden in the
intervals of teaching the children of the village. Fugda, chief of
T’imia, is one of the cleverest men in Air. Under the guidance of
these two men the community has prospered. The villagers are
enterprising. In the changing conditions of things they are an
exception to the usual rule, for the men combine caravaning and
trading on a large scale with gardening and date cultivation,
without the help of any Imghad. When we came this way some of their
camels were fattening in Abarakan ready to go to Bilma with the
annual salt caravan in charge of a selected party of men. Another
herd of some 100 head was going to Damergu to fetch millet for sale
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> the French post
at Agades, and later I met yet another drove in Assada going south
from Iferuan by way of Auderas to fetch more grain for sale in
Northern Air after working on transport duties in Nigeria for the
winter.</p>
<p>The life of the camel-owning Tuareg may be said to centre round
the autumn salt caravan, which all the best camels accompany. It
usually leaves in October, starting from Tabello<a id=
"FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class=
"fnanchor">[208]</a> in the upper Beughqot valley, where parties
from all over Air, Damergu and the Southland rendezvous in order to
start together. Since the war these caravans have been
comparatively small, but even during the last few years they have
numbered 5000 camels. Ever since the occupation of Agades by the
French, the Camel Corps has been turned out to guard the
concentration and escort the caravan across the desert, for so
valuable a congregation of camels might any year, as it sometimes
did in the past, prove an irresistible temptation for raiders. The
largest caravan ever escorted reached the fantastic total of over
30,000 camels. The caravan marches for five days to the oasis of
Fashi, where it is joined by a smaller caravan from Damagarim via
Termit. There, a halt is made for a short time to water and feed on
whatever scanty pasture is available, and in some three more days
Bilma is reached. The animals go out empty except for a little
grain or live meat in the form of goats and sheep, and some trade
goods for the Tebu and Kanuri inhabitants of Fashi and Kawar and
Tibesti. They bring back salt and dates both from Fashi and Bilma.
The latter place has perhaps the finest salt deposits in Africa. It
costs nothing to get except the labour at the pans of making it up
into loaves and loading it wrapped in matting bales. The outlay may
be threepence to fivepence a load, in addition to an export tax of
two francs per camel levied by the French authorities. The salt is
sold in Hausaland for anything up to 7<em>s.</em> or more a loaf
according to the time of year. As a fully-grown camel can carry
four to six loaves of salt, the trade is extremely lucrative.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>Both Fashi, or
Agram as the place is also called, and Kawar have practically no
pasture, and the few camels which live permanently there eat dates.
The desert for five and a half days between Tabello and Fashi and
three days between Fashi and Bilma is not only waterless but also
nearly pastureless as well. The camels start out loaded with a
sufficient supply of fodder for the outward and return journeys;
the huge bales of grass are dropped <em>en route</em> at the end of
each day’s march to provide for the equivalent return stage. Since
the practice of escorting caravans has been instituted the French
authorities quite rightly forbid isolated parties crossing the
desert and attracting raiders to the neighbourhood. The route now
chosen for the caravan runs from Tabello to Tazizilet on the edge
of the Air mountains, and then straight across to Fashi in an
almost due easterly direction. Formerly another road, which was
more convenient for the northern tribes of Air, was also in use. It
left the mountains at Agamgam pool in North-east Air and went to
Ashegur well, north of Fashi; this way the distances between
watering-points was shortened, and there was also rather more
pasture.</p>
<p>This annual salt caravan is the largest enterprise of its sort
in the world at the present time. It is called in Air the
“Taghalam,” a word derived from “aghelam,” meaning a “prize camel,”
but the French call it the “Azalai,” which means the “Parting” or
the “Separation,” the name given to a similar caravan which
annually leaves Timbuctoo to collect salt at Taodenit for sale
along the Niger.</p>
<p>With the advent of European salt in Nigeria the trade has become
somewhat less remunerative, as the Air “Taghalam” no longer enjoys
its ancient monopoly in the Central Sudan, but the infinitesimal
cost of production and the cheap transport in the hands of nomads
will always enable it to compete with the imported European trade
product to some extent. Bilma salt is of good quality; it is
comparatively free from sand or medicinal chemicals and is
preferred by the natives of the south to the purer European
product.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> The loaves
are made up in conical form and are pink in colour, standing some
18-24″ high by 9-12″ at the base.</p>
<p>The return journey of the “Taghalam” follows the same course as
the outward one. The whole trip, which is extremely strenuous for
men and camels alike, takes some three weeks. There are always a
number of casualties among the camels from exhaustion, but so large
are the profits that every Tuareg is ready to take the risk and
send as many of his herd as he can possibly spare at least once a
year, either in the autumn or on the smaller “Taghalam” which goes
in the spring. After returning from Bilma the camels are rested and
then proceed to Damergu and the south to sell their salt and their
services. They are joined by any other camels fit to go, and when
they have disposed of their merchandise engage in transport work
between the cities of the Southland until about March or April.
Then they begin to move north again before the rains set in in the
Sudan. The proceeds of this work and of the sale of Bilma salt, or
dates from Fashi and Air, are invested in grain and such trade
goods as cotton cloth, tea, sugar, snuff and hardware, which are
the only luxuries of Air. By the time they reach the mountains the
summer rains have probably begun, and they have some three months
in which to recuperate on the fresh pasture of the hills in
preparation for the next year’s routine.</p>
<p>Transactions in salt and grain are measured by the camel load,
which varies considerably from place to place. Metrology is not an
exact science in Air, but recognised standards nevertheless exist.
The actual measures are kept by the tribal chiefs, and it is, of
course, common gossip to hear it said that a certain chief gives
unduly short weight. The only truly Tuareg measure is a unit of
capacity; in the first instance it is the handful, whether of grain
or salt or other commodity. But the measure has been standardised
by establishing that a handful shall be as much millet grain as an
ordinary man can pick up in his hand with the fingers<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> <em>closed</em> palm
upwards.<a id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class=
"fnanchor">[209]</a> Six such handfuls nominally make one
“tefakint,” which is measured by heaping the grain in a small
circular basket with sloping sides 1¾″ deep × 3⅝″ in diameter at
the mouth × 2″ at the bottom. The next larger measure is the
“muda,” a cylindrical wooden cup with a hemispherical bottom in a
<span class="sym">U</span> section. As the handful and the
“tefakint” are too small to measure bulky wares like dates, the
“muda” has become the effectual standard in the country, but it
varies in certain areas. At Auderas it is of five “tefakint,” but
in Agades of ten. The T’imia and Kel Owi or Ighazar “muda” is
different again, three of them being the same as two Auderas or one
Agades “muda.” The three “mudas” are, however, generally recognised
and are not the subject of bargaining in each transaction. The
measure corresponding to the Air “tefakint” basket in Damergu is a
round section cut from a large calabash; this slightly convex plate
is held by a loop for the fingers fixed to the underside. All these
grain measures are considered to be full when the grain is heaped
up so that it runs over the edge.</p>
<p>For small weights the silver five-franc piece, or “sinko” as it
is called, is now also used, especially in measuring the value of
silver ornaments. The rate of exchange current in 1922 in Air at
Agades was four silver shillings or five silver francs to the
“sinko”; a general rate of five obtained elsewhere in Air, as
silver francs and shillings were not distinguished from each other.
The people of Air have the nomads’ dislike for paper currency in
any form. Various coins, including the Maria Teresa dollar, are
still in circulation, but French coinage is gradually replacing all
others. Cowrie shells are no longer used and gold is now unknown.
The mithkal of Agades dates from the time when the gold trade was
still flourishing, and its form here is peculiar to this city. It
seems to have been a unit of weight and not of currency; as a
recognised amount of gold it was used as<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_222">[222]</span> the basis for striking bargains, but the
metal probably did not pass from hand to hand owing to the
inconvenience of handling dust. With the decline of the gold trade
the mithkal survived as a unit of weight, but its theoretical value
changed considerably in the course of centuries. We find in Barth’s
day the exchange was reckoned at 1 mithkal = 1000 cowries, and 2500
cowries = 1 Maria Teresa dollar; but whereas the Agades mithkal was
only worth two-fifths of a dollar, the Timbuctoo mithkal was worth
one-third of a dollar. It is interesting to arrive by a round-about
method at a rough estimate of the change in value of the unit.</p>
<p>The mithkal as a simple unit of weight was a part of a larger
unit in the following equation:<a id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> 100 mithkal = 3 small
karruwe = 1 large karruwe = 6½ Arab rottls. The Arab rottl weight
varies between 225 grammes in Persia and about 160 grammes in
Cairo, several slightly different standard rottls being used in
other parts of Egypt. Taking 160 grammes as the equivalent of 1
rottl, and assuming Barth’s equation to be correct, we get 10·4
grammes for the Agades mithkal. The unit of 10·4 grammes of gold
dust in the fifteenth century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> was in
the nineteenth century equal to two-fifths of a Maria Teresa dollar
weighing 28·0668 grammes silver 0·833 fine, or in other words, 13·5
grammes of silver.</p>
<p>The only measures of length in Air are the “aghil” (plural
“ighillan”)<a id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class=
"fnanchor">[211]</a> and the “tedi” or “teddi.” The former is the
universal dra’, ell or cubit measured from the inner elbow-point to
the first joint of the middle finger on an average man, say 5 ft.
10 in. tall. Ten “ighillan” make one “amitral,” the two measures
being only used for cloth, etc. The “tedi” is the fathom and is
used for measuring the depth of wells or the length of rope, etc.
There is no measure in Air for distance, which is invariably
calculated by the parts of a day or the number of days taken to
cover the ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>The pack-saddle
of Air is peculiar to the country. It is very simple, consisting of
two sheaves of grass or straw, two semi-circular pieces of matting
made of plaited dûm palm fronds, a skin filled with grain or
stuffed with dry camel dung and a wooden arch terminating in flat
boards. A bundle of grass, with the butt ends even and trimmed, is
laid on the semi-circular mat, which is then rolled around it and
sewn up with ribbands of palm frond by a long wooden or iron
bodkin; the flowery ends of the grass project beyond the matting.
One of these mat cylinders or cushions is fitted each side of the
camel’s hump with the butts nearly touching one another over the
withers. Over these pads is placed the arch of wood, the ends of
which terminate in boards some 9″ × 3″ at the ends, resting on the
pads, which are tied on with twisted dûm palm rope. A stuffed
goatskin thrown transversely over the back of the camel behind the
hump forms a rear pad. Its corners are tied to the two ends of the
arch with adjustable cords to regulate the distance between them.
The loads, which must be carefully balanced, are slung over the
pack-saddle; two loops on each load are hitched to the other two on
the other load with two short sticks. The weight of the load rests
on the side pads and the ends of the back pad; the load cords bear
on the latter and on the side pads just in front of the wooden
arch, which prevents them slipping backwards. The load ropes rest
on, and are not tied to, the saddle. No girths, crupper or
breastband are used unless the loads are very bulky or need special
steadying. Unloading is extraordinarily simple, for as soon as the
camel has been knelt down the loops are disconnected by pulling out
the short sticks and the loads fall down on either side.</p>
<p>The pack-saddle is simple and cheap, but is not efficient on
steep slopes where the camel may stumble or lurch awkwardly. As
these conditions prevail all over Air, the arrangement is really
far from ideal, though in the plain land it is practical enough.
The principal advantages are that every part of the saddle is
easily adjustable to suit any particular camel, while the whole
equipment weighs next<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_224">[224]</span> to nothing. The goatskin used as the back
pad on long journeys is filled with a provision of grain, saving an
additional receptacle on each camel of the caravan. The resultant
economy of space and bulk is unequalled in any other system.</p>
<p>The rest of the camel’s equipment consists of a head rope, a
hobbling rope and the load ropes. In Air all rope is made of split
dûm palm fronds soaked in water till they have fermented, or, if no
time is available, from fresh material. The strips are twisted like
ordinary two or three strand “cable laid” rope. It is a strong,
serviceable material costing nothing and available everywhere where
the dûm palm grows, which is all over Air and the Sudan. The
scarcity of date palms precludes the use of the brown fibre which
grows below the fronds, known to camel travellers in the north. The
dûm palm rope does not wear so well as the latter but is easier to
manufacture. Every camel-man in Air spends a certain part of the
day making rope, twisting the fronds from split ribbands about ¼-½″
broad, bundles of which he carries about; he sits on the ground
talking and twisting, using his big toe to hold the end of the rope
he has made, and weaving in strand after strand with incredible
speed. The rope is nearly all two-stranded cable, but the tightness
of twist and the finish vary with the use. Load ropes are very
closely twisted cable, passed twice round the package at each end
and terminating in a loop adjusted by a running half-hitch to raise
or lower the load on the side of the camel. Lashing rope and rough
nets are made of loosely twisted strands. The camel head rope is a
long piece with a slip knot at one end passed over the lower jaw of
the camel and pulled tight behind its front teeth. Hobble ropes are
stout lengths passed round one foreleg, then twisted and passed
round the other, leaving about 18″ of movement between the limbs:
the ends are secured by passing a knot through a small loop.
Carefully made rope is beaten with a stone to make the strands pack
tightly.</p>
<p>Loading camels is hard work and can only properly be done by two
men. The pack-saddle is put on the kneeling<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_225">[225]</span> camel, which is prevented from rising by
slipping one of his knees through a looped hobble rope, which, when
not in use, is carried round the animal’s neck. The camel protests
vigorously in season and out of season and pretends to bite the
men. They work stripped to the waist, wearing only their trousers
tucked up to the thigh, and the inevitable veil. They stagger under
150 to 200 lbs. loads, swinging them on to the camel’s back,
slipping the loops through one another and securing them with the
two sticks. The camel is then released, gets up with a jerky
movement resembling a deck chair being opened, and probably throws
its burden to the ground immediately, when the operation
recommences. If this does not happen at once the head rope is
secured to the next camel in front with a half-hitch that can be
released by pulling the free end. By the time fifty camels have
been loaded, at least five in an endeavour to graze on the same
bush have bumped into one another and their loads have fallen off.
The operation of loading may take place in the early morning when
it is cool, or before dawn when it is always cold, or at noon when
the temperature is like a furnace; it is always tedious and
tiresome and bad for the temper, which the incessant complaining of
the camels aggravates.</p>
<p>Eventually the caravan moves off. The camel-men walk along,
watching their loads if they are conscientious, and when everything
is going well they climb up on their camels and sit on the loads.
They jump up on to the neck of the camel after pulling its head
down and so reach the top, but they never kneel a camel after it
has started on the march until the day’s journey is over, unless
the load has been thrown or has slipped very badly. The guide takes
the head of the caravan and the march starts. The Tuareg of Air
know their mountains as well as the average Londoner knows London:
they can find their way along the more important tracks. For the
less known ways a special guide must be found: in the outer deserts
the reliable guides can be counted on the fingers of both hands.
Efale, the leader of the “Taghalam” and veteran of the Eastern
Desert, T’ekhmedin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
and Kalama on the northern routes—are all resourceful, patient and
observant men when travelling, but complete autocrats whose orders
cannot be questioned. Their knowledge of the roads depends on
estimation of time and memory and not on any supernatural powers.
They know the stars<a id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and have some sense of direction, but
especially do they know every fold of ground and almost every bush.
Their powers are remarkable but not inexplicable; their observation
and memory rarely fail them, but for obvious reasons they do not
care to travel by night. Once started the march goes on hour after
hour. The heat grows more intense. The narrow path winds down the
bed of a valley or among the trees on the banks, or over rocky
plains or amid sand dunes.</p>
<p>In Air the vegetation exists principally along the valleys. In
the south the dûm palm grows in veritable forests or in low
thickets, when it resembles the dwarf palm. The <i>Acacia
Adansonii</i>, <i>Acacia Arabica</i> (“Tamat” in Temajegh),
<i>Acacia Tortilis</i> (the “Talha” of the Arabs and “Abesagh” or
“Tiggeur” in Temajegh), as well as two or three other varieties,
are common. They occasionally grow to very large dimensions. The
Aborak (<i>Balanites Ægyptiaca</i>) also does very well; trees with
trunks up to 2 feet in diameter are common in the larger valleys,
and in North-eastern Air I have seen some up to 3½ feet across. The
bushes and grasses are innumerable, but flowers are rare, except
for the yellow and white mimosa blossom on the trees. Nearly all
the trees and bushes are thorned, some with recurving barbs which
are dangerous for the careless rider. If burr grass is less
frequent than in the south, spear grass abounds and is almost as
painful. Vegetation in Air defends itself against pasturing animals
vigorously but vainly, for the animals in the country seem to
thrive on a diet of thorns, and man ends up by being the worst
sufferer from these useless provisions of Nature. Thorns are not
the only minor horror of life. How often after a long march has
some delicious glade appeared at<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_227">[227]</span> hand, cool and inviting. After angrily
dismissing the suggestion to choose a camp site in the middle of an
open river-bed where the sun on the sand will cook an egg in a few
minutes, you throw yourself down to rest in deep green shade fanned
by the breeze. The unwary traveller soon learns the consequences of
disregarding native advice, for he will quickly arise from a bed of
thorns with his clothes full of burrs, and his mouth full of bad
words, while his whole attention will probably be directed towards
dodging a large tarantula or scorpion or, happily less often, a
little yellow-crested sand viper, than which there is hardly
anything more deadly in all Africa.</p>

<p>Apart from trades directly connected with camels the Tuareg have
practically no industries. They neither dye nor spin anything,
except a rough sewing thread of local cotton; nor do they weave in
wool or cotton. Mats of two sorts are made; the one of palm fronds
plaited in bands some two to three inches broad and sewn together
spirally to form rectangles or ovals worked in varying degrees of
fineness, the other made of stiff grass and thin strips of black
leather. The technique of the latter is good: deep borders with an
intricate geometric ornament are woven in the leather warp.
Mat-making and leather-working are carried on by the women. They
attain great skill, but although leather-working is usual all over
the country, it is at Agades that the craft is especially well
developed. Fine designs in coloured strips of leather are made on
cushions, bags and pouches like a sort of embroidery. The industry
is in the hands of a few women and is probably of Manding origin,
brought to Air by the Songhai conquerors or even before. Decorated
camel riding saddles, leather head ropes and travelling wallets or
pouches of various shapes are made. The leather used is the
goatskin locally tanned with the seed pod of the “Tamat” acacia,
and dyed with red maize leaf or indigo. A certain amount of
prepared leather is also imported from the south. In these articles
the foundation is usually of black leather, which is ornamented
with coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
strips or bands and metal studs. Camel head ropes are made of
twisted or plaited leather strands with coloured tassels; the more
elaborate, the finer are the strands used; the tassels are bound
with coloured leather threads woven in patterns. The technique of
these head ropes is the best of its sort I have ever seen. Cutting
leather in strands to the thickness of coarse sewing thread is a
highly skilled art, and all the more remarkable in that only knives
are used, for scissors are unknown except in the blacksmiths’
equipment. I have seen cords for carrying amulets or pouches made
of ten or a dozen threads, each less than ¹⁄₃₂″ thick, bound at
intervals and at the ends.</p>
<p>A most characteristic article is a flat rectangular envelope of
leather some 6″ long × 3″ broad. It is only open at the bottom and
slides up and down the two cords, by which a sort of portfolio is
hung from the neck; this consists of four to six leather flaps in
which amulets, trinkets, needles and papers are preserved. The
black cover is ornamented with some stamped rectilinear pattern and
has small tassels at the bottom. A similar object is the small
leather amulet case about 3″ broad × 2″ long × 1″ deep, also slung
round the neck, and provided with a lid like a box. A larger
semi-circular pouch with a design in strips of coloured leather
suspended over the shoulder by a long cord is typical Agades work.
Triangular travelling bags of all sizes are made of soft leather,
closed at the neck with a running cord; they vary in size from
those 5 inches long for snuff to others 2 feet or more for clothing
and food. Both these bags and ornamented goatskins for packing
personal belongings have polychrome patterns on the surface, which
is roughed and rubbed with moist dyes. The plaited head ropes and
the surface dyeing of leather seem to be a more indigenous
technique than the “Agades work” proper, in which the design is
procured by appliqué strips.</p>
<p>Carpentry is rudimentary and the craft akin to iron-working. The
artisan, known as the “Enad” or smith, whatever his caste, is a
person of standing in the community:<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229">[229]</span> he is a man whose advice is sought in
council though he rarely becomes a leader. In the olden days the
“Enad” is said even to have had a peculiar form of grave to
distinguish his resting-place from that of other men, but however
this may have been, there is nothing now to show that the smith of
Air ever belonged to a separate race or caste. To-day the smith is
only respected for his skill. The position is usually hereditary
and includes the duties of the blacksmith, jeweller, carpenter and
farrier, with the same set of tools for all these trades. His adze
is an acute-angled crook of wood with a socketed iron cutting edge
bound on to the point of the short limb; the form dates back at
least to the Neolithic period of civilisation. The axe is equally
primitive: the cutting edge, instead of having a socket, ends in a
point which is fitted into a hole bored through the club head of a
wooden haft. With these two tools, a few hammers, usually of
European shape, tin-shears, pincers, files and chisels, the “Enad”
contrives to turn out some remarkably fine work. Using only his
adze he will cut spoons with a pointed bowl at a slight angle to
the flat handle, or round ladles, from a solid block of “Aborak”
wood. They are then ornamented with geometric patterns burnt on the
handles around the edge. The Air “Enad” does not smelt iron, for
all the presence of ironstone in the hills and magnetite sand in
the river-beds. The only iron-working done is quite simple bending,
beating or tempering on an anvil shaped like a huge horseshoe nail
planted in the ground. A goatskin bellows closed by two wooden
slats and a clay nozzle are used as in the Southland. The iron is
heated in a hearth in the sand filled with charcoal. A certain
number of inferior iron knives are forged, but the Tuareg of Air
must be regarded as having hardly yet reached the iron-working age
of evolution.</p>
<p>The Agades blacksmith-jewellers melt down silver coins heated in
small clay crucibles. They lose a lot of silver by oxidation, but
the work is remarkably well finished, considering the primitive
nature of their tools and the heavy hammers employed. The wooden
household furniture will<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_230">[230]</span> be described later; so far as there is any
at all, it is well made, but rough. The principal skill of the
smiths is displayed in making and decorating camel riding saddles
and certain <span class="sym">U</span>-shaped luggage rests, to
which particular reference will be made hereafter.</p>
<p>The Tuareg riding saddle, or “tirik” (“t’iriken” in the plural)
in Temajegh, or “rahla” in Arabic, is a highly efficient
production, combining comfort with extreme lightness. It consists
of a circular seat over an inverted <span class="sym">V</span>
frame which fits across the withers of the camel. High above the
seat are a broad, tall cantle shaped like a Gothic arch and large
cross pommel. The whole saddle weighs perhaps 10 lbs. at the most.
Its equipment includes a quilted saddle cloth over the withers and
a single plaited leather girth two inches broad. No iron is used in
the saddle, except for two rings which pull by diagonal straps from
the underside of the seat over the flat <span class="sym">Ʌ</span>
shaped frame of the saddle. The girth is permanently attached to
these straps at one end, the other end is lashed to the ring on the
off-side straps by a leather thong. The seat, cantle and pommel are
made of separate pieces of wood held together by raw hide, which is
pulled over them wet and dried in place; the violent contraction of
the hide holds the component parts together as firmly as if they
were screwed or dovetailed. The broad <span class="sym">Ʌ</span>
sides which fit over the withers are of soft tanned leather
stretched over a rectangular frame: the upper part is covered with
leather over hide and wood. The common saddle has dark red leather
over the seat and cantle and black leather over the cross pommel
and along the edges of the cantle. The elaborate decoration of the
more ornate patterns is invariably the same. In this variety the
seat and edging are of red and black leather as previously
described, but the back of the cantle and the front of the cross
pommel are covered with pale green leather, on which is applied a
geometric decoration of horizontal and diagonal strips of stamped
and fretted silver or white metal, with red cloth showing through
the holes. Every example I saw<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_231">[231]</span> had the same green leather background on
the front of the pommel and back of the cantle. I observed no
instance where the ornament was on a different background or where
green leather without the silver metal design had been used. Where
the design comes from I have no idea; it is remarkably well
executed and dignified without being so barbaric in splendour as
the horse saddles of the Sudan. Every element of the construction
and ornament is traditional and rigidly adhered to. I can offer no
suggestions regarding its origin, but can only note its presence.
Some symbolism is probably involved.</p>

<p>Where a man can afford to have a leather bridle he usually
dispenses with the running noose which, when rope is used, is
slipped over the camel’s lower jaw behind the front teeth. The
leather bridle is fitted to a head collar consisting of an arched
iron nose-piece with a curved iron jowl-piece attached to one side
by a brass or copper link ring. The bridle is fastened to the other
end of the jowl-piece and runs through a ring on the nose-piece
itself, so that any pull on the bridle closes the former on to the
latter, compressing the jaws of the camel. The nose-piece is kept
in position by a horizontal band of plaited leather attached to the
ends and passing round the back of the camel’s head below the ears.
The top of the arched nose-piece is usually shaped into a loop on
to which a crest of black ostrich feathers may be attached.<a id=
"FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class=
"fnanchor">[213]</a> As an alternative or in addition to this
equipment the riding camel often also has a nose-ring in the left
nostril for a light rope or leather bridle. The nose-ring is the
mark of a good riding camel, but is sometimes not employed for
guiding the animal, as its use necessitates light hands to avoid
injuring the beast.</p>
<p>In addition to its lightness the Tuareg riding saddle has the
inestimable merit of bringing the weight of the rider over the
shoulders of the camel, or in other words over the part where the
animal is strongest. The hinder parts of the camel are sloping and
can carry no weight; all the heavy<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232">[232]</span> work is done by the fore-legs. The rider,
sitting in the saddle, which must be arranged with padding if
necessary over the front part of the withers to bring the seat
horizontal, rests one foot against the vertical part of the camel’s
neck just above its curve, holding on to the neck with a prehensile
big toe. The other leg is crooked below and falls over the opposite
shoulder of the camel at the base of the neck. Bare feet are
essential for good riding, as, in addition to enabling some grip to
be obtained, they are used to guide the camel with recognised
“aids.” With a broad cantle and a high pommel between the legs a
far better grip can be obtained than on the Arabian saddle, on
which a good seat is entirely a question of balance. Provided the
saddle cloth under the Tuareg saddle is properly adjusted there is
practically no galling of the withers or sides. If provisions or
water-skins are carried they are slung under the seat of the riding
saddle, their front ends attached to the girth rings, their rear
ends tied together behind the hump, resting on a small pad to
prevent rubbing over the backbone.</p>
<p>The large goatskins for water and small ones for meal do not
differ from those used throughout the East. The goat is skinned
without cutting the hide except around the neck and limbs: the skin
is peeled off the carcass and well greased. The legs are sewn up
and roped for slinging: rents or holes are skilfully sewn up or
patched with leather and cotton thread so that they do not leak. A
new skin recently greased with goat or sheep fat is abominable, as
the water becomes strongly impregnated with the reek of goat. But
water from a good old skin can be almost tasteless, though such
skins are hard to come by. Some of the water one has drunk from
goatskins beggars description; it is nearly always grey or black,
and smelly beyond belief. The one compensation is that the wet
outside of the skin keeps the water deliciously cool owing to
constant evaporation. With a riding saddle, a skin of water and a
skin of meal or grain as his sole equipment, the Tuareg reduces the
complications of travelling to a minimum.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>His weapons are
few but characteristic. First and foremost he wears a sword, called
“takuba,” as soon as he reaches man’s estate, and before even he
dons the veil. His sword has been romantically associated with the
Crusaders and I know not who else. It is a straight, flat,
double-edged cutting sword of the old cross-hilted type up to 3 ft.
6 ins. long by 2-3½ ins. broad below the hilt, tapering slightly to
a rounded point. The guard is square and broad and the hilt is
short, for the Tuareg have small hands. The pommel is flattened and
ornamented. The hilt and guard form a Latin cross. The type never
varies, though of course the blades differ greatly in quality and
form, ranging from old Toledo steels with the mark “Carlos V” on
them to an iron object called a “Masri” blade made in the north.
Some are elaborately ornamented, but the most prized are plain with
two or three slight canellations down the middle; they are probably
of European manufacture. The commonest Masri blades bear two
opposed crescent “men in the moon” faces as their mark; another
cheap variety has a small couchant lion. The Tuareg prizes his
sword as his most valued possession and many, like Ahodu, speak
with pride of a blade handed down in their families for
generations. His particular sword was reputed to have magical
properties, for it had been lost in a fight at Assode, where the
owner, rather than allow it to be captured, had thrown it from him
into the air, only, through the instrumentality of a slave, to find
it again many years afterwards, buried deep in the rocky ground on
a hillock near the site of the battle. The sword is worn in a red
leather scabbard slung from two rings by a cotton band over the
shoulder. The edges of the blades are kept very sharp. As a weapon
these swords are quite effective. Ahodu in a raid received a sword
wound from a blow which had glanced off his shield; it ran from the
left shoulder to the left knee, and had cut deep into his arm and
side. It would have killed most Europeans; he not only recovered
but had to ride four days from the scene of the fight back to
Air.</p>
<p>Two sorts of spears are used, the wooden-hafted with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> a narrow willow-leaf socketed
blade and an iron socketed butt, and one made throughout of metal.
The latter, called “allagh,” is a slender and beautiful weapon up
to six feet long.<a id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214"
class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The head is very narrow, not above an
inch broad: the greatest breadth is half-way down the blade, which
projects on either side of a pronounced midrib. Below the head are
one or more pairs of barbs in the plane of the blade. The haft is
round and about half an inch in diameter, inlaid with brass rings.
Two-thirds of the way along the haft is a leather grip; below that
is an annular excrescence, and then the haft is splayed out,
terminating in a chisel-shaped butt 1½″-2″ broad. These spears are
used as lances or as throwing weapons. They are graceful and
well-balanced, but are not made locally. Wherever they appear the
influence of the Tuareg can seemingly be traced. It was from this
people also that the cross-hilted sword probably came to be adopted
in the Sudan, while they themselves certainly learnt its use in the
Mediterranean lands, perhaps even from the Romans.</p>
<p>Sheath knives some 6″ long, with fretted or inlaid brass hilts
and red leather or leather and brass sheaths, are worn at the
waist. The arm dagger is the most typical of all Tuareg weapons.
They seem to be the only people to use it: it has a small wooden
cross hilt and a long, narrow, flat blade. This weapon is worn
along the forearm, the point to the elbow, the hilt ready for use
under the hand: the sheath has a leather ring which is slipped over
the wrist. The hilt is held in the hand, knuckles upward and two
fingers each side of the long member of the cross. It is, in fact,
a short stabbing sword, the handiest and most redoubtable of all
the weapons of the People of the Veil.</p>
<p>For defence they have large shields<a id=
"FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class=
"fnanchor">[215]</a> roughly rectangular in shape and as large as 5
ft. × 3 ft., of sun-dried hide from which the hair has been
removed. The best are made in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_235">[235]</span> Elakkos and some parts of Damergu of oryx
hide. The edges are bound in leather, but the shield remains stiff
yet fairly flexible, as it consists of only one thickness of hide.
The corners are rounded and the sides somewhat incurved, the bottom
being usually a few inches broader than the top. A loop in the
centre of the top side is used to hang the shield from the camel
saddle. In use it is held in the left hand by a handle attached
behind about a third of its length from the top rim. There are no
arm loops, as the shield is too ungainly to move rapidly in parry,
though its size effectually protects the whole body. The hide of
the white oryx is extremely tough and is said to turn any sword-cut
and most spear-thrusts. The shield is especially remarkable for its
ornamentation. Some of the more elaborate have metal studs with
roundels of red stuff near the edges, but an uncoloured cruciform
design worked on the surface by a series of small cuts always
appears in the upper part of the shield on the centre line. The
design in all examples I have seen, and probably in most cases, is
much the same and is certainly symbolic, for we hear of the shield
and cross ornament being engraved on rocks. The design seems to be
derived from a Latin cross, the lower and longer arm of which
terminates in a group of diagonal members, usually three on each
side, forming a radial pattern. In this form it resembles nothing
so much as the Christian cross standing on a radiating mass
representing light or glory, but certain examples have the
radiating marks at the top as well as at the bottom of the
cross.</p>
<p>The Tuareg does not usually use either bows and arrows or the
throwing iron with its many projecting knife-blades. Instances are
not wanting in which these weapons have been used, but they are
neither typical of the equipment of the Tuareg nor natural to his
temperament. Where they have been used they have been consciously
borrowed from some neighbouring or associated people, such as the
Tebu, who use the throwing iron extensively. The People of the Veil
have one most especial vaunt, which is that they fight<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> with the <em>armes
blanches</em> and disdain insidious weapons like arrows. The advent
of civilisation has brought them the rifle, which they are as proud
to possess as any fighting man must be, but they have never been
seduced from the sword, spear and knife which are their old
allegiances. It is common to hear a Tuareg say that he would be
ashamed to stoop to the infamy of the Tebu: he will explain that
whatever happens the Tuareg will never creep up to a camp at night
and cut his enemy’s throat in the dark. He will fight fair and
clean, attacking with spear and sword, preferably by day. He prides
himself on the distinction which he draws between murder by stealth
and killing in a fight or raid. He may be a liar and not live up to
his vaunt; but to have the ideal at all is remarkable; it must be
said to his honour that on the whole he has proved that he can live
up to his self-set standard. In all the bitter fighting with the
French during the last two generations I am only aware of one
instance in which the Tuareg have stooped to what in their own view
was treachery, and that was when they tried to poison the survivors
of the Flatters Mission after the attack at Bir Gharama.</p>
<p>Their tactics in war are the usual ones of desert fighting.
Guerilla warfare, ambushes, surprise attacks and harassing descents
on stragglers are all known. On one occasion in an attack on a
French patrol, which had exacted a fine of camels from a tribe, the
men came up in the dark on the opposite side of the square to that
on which the animals were lying and called to them, whereupon the
animals, recognising the voices of their masters, rose and swept
through the sleeping camp, which was over-run and decimated. In the
desert men neither give nor get quarter, for prisoners and slaves
are encumbrances to free movement. In ordinary raids the losing
side is either destroyed or dispersed.</p>

<p>As far as possible the Tuareg fight according to their code,
which in a less cynical age would be called chivalrous. They obey
the injunctions of Islam neither to destroy palm trees nor to
poison wells. They will give water in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_237">[237]</span> desert to their worst enemy. They will lie
and deceive their opponent whenever possible, but they will not
infringe the laws of hospitality. When they have given the “Amán”
or peace, they do not break their word. They are faithful to the
tribes which they take under their protection and to those who have
received their “A’ada” or “right of passage,” confirmed with the
“Timmi” or oath suitable to the occasion. Their reputation as base
fighters has little real foundation. Every case of which I have
heard, when such an accusation was brought against them, has
resolved itself into some surprise attack by a raiding party, the
essence of whose success depended upon an unexpected descent upon
an unsuspecting enemy. Of their courage I will write nothing, for
it is too easy to exaggerate; but their proverb says: “Hell itself
abhors dishonour.”</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span><a id=
"c08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p class="sch">ARCHITECTURE AND ART</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> Bagezan group looms large in Central
Air, but even its general features are unknown. The mountains have
neither been reconnoitred nor mapped. The area they occupy figures
as a blank on the Cortier map. I travelled around Bagezan and
climbed up into one broad valley in the heart of the massif, but my
own additions to the cartography hereabouts are confined to a few
details along the towering sides. Buchanan in 1919-20 crossed the
western side, from Towar to a valley which runs into the Anu
Maqaran basin, where it is called Abarakan. A detachment of Jean’s
first patrol to Air visited the southern valleys. But no European
has ever entered the eastern or north-eastern part of the group.
The reason for this apparent lack of enterprise is due to few of
the mountain tracks being fit for camels; many of them are not even
suitable for donkeys, and the complications of travelling in this
sort of country, where none of the inhabitants will act as porters,
thus become considerable.</p>
<p>The massif rises some 2000 feet above the general level of the
central plateau, except in the north-east, where the latter at 3500
feet above the sea is itself over 500 feet higher than in the north
and west. The principal peaks must be well over 6000 feet, the
bottoms of the upland valleys perhaps 3500 to 4000 feet above the
sea. Many of the latter contain perennial streams, and rumours
reached me of a small lake somewhere in the unexplored
north-eastern part; but this may only be a fairy tale. The southern
sides of Bagezan fall almost vertically on to the central plain
between Towar and Arakieta on the upper Beughqot valley. Several
small villages are hidden in the folds of the mountains
above,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> wherever
there is a permanent supply of water. In some cases the streams are
sufficient to irrigate a few gardens; at one or two points there
are some date palms and the only lime trees in Air. The climate is
cooler and everything ripens some four to six weeks later than on
the plateau below. Frost is common in the winter.</p>
<p>A few of the villages, notably those like Tasessat and Tadesa,
near the southern edge of the massif, have been visited by French
patrols. In addition settlements known as Atkaki, Emululi, Owari,
Agaragar and Ighelablaban have been reported to exist, but
generally speaking, owing to the difficulties of
intercommunication, the villages are almost unknown. They are said
to consist of stone houses apparently of the earliest period
associated with the Itesan tribes, in whose country the mountains
lay. Some of the houses, however, differ from any of those
encountered in other districts of Air.</p>
<p>In order to see the type of country and visit some of the people
of the mountains I climbed from Towar up to the Telezu valley,
where there were some Kel Bagezan, to-day a composite tribe made up
of portions of Kel Tadek imghad and various Kel Owi elements. They
are under the chief Minéru or El Minir, who owes allegiance to the
Añastafidet. My way from Towar led past the ruined town of Agejir
to the Tokede valley, which soon turned east and disappeared into
the mountain. I subsequently found that the Tokede was the same
valley as the one called Telesu higher up and Towar further down.
The path turned west along the foot of Bagezan, past a scree of
enormous boulders, ranging from five to twenty-five feet across, on
which numerous families of red monkeys were playing. There we
turned, T’ekhmedin, Atagoom and myself, and wound up the side of
the mountain by a path so steep and rough that a self-respecting
mule would have walked warily. The camels went up and up over loose
stones. The left side dropped away precipitately into the deep
valley which divides massifs of Bagezan and Todra. A stream roared
in a gorge hundreds of feet below at the foot<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_240">[240]</span> of a cliff of gleaming rock. Still we
climbed over stones and boulders by a two-foot path gradually
turning north and then north-east and then east. We followed up a
narrowing tributary bed of the stream in the gorge until we came to
a pass between bare earth-coloured hills, the tops of which were
only a few hundred feet above us, and at last dropped gently down
the other side past some grazing camels which seemed interested in
our arrival and followed us inquisitively into Telezu. An enclosed
plain opened out full of big green trees and grass with wonderful
pasture and plenty of water in the sand. It ran from west to east
before turning and narrowing southwards to fall over the edge into
the Tokede below. The valley was shut in all round by low peaks and
rough crags along the sky-line. One had no impression of being so
far above the plateau of Air on a higher table-land. The great
summits of Bagezan had become small hills.</p>
<p>There was no other way out of Telesu except on foot, either over
the hills or down the ravine made by the stream falling towards
Tokede, so we returned as we had come, after drinking milk with the
Kel Bagezan who were living there. The descent was terrific; the
camels had to be led and we only made Towar by nightfall. After
reaching the bottom of the scree we cut off a corner instead of
going by Agejir, and marched towards the standing rock of Takazuzat
(or Takazanzat), which looks like the spire of a cathedral, on the
edge of the Ara valley near the isolated peak of In Bodinam.</p>
<p>All the ways up to the Bagezan villages are similar, if not
harder. The agility of the camels that have to negotiate these
paths is unbelievable until it has been experienced.</p>
<p>The only account which I can give of the houses of Bagezan is
second-hand, and this is the more unfortunate, because Jean’s
description<a id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class=
"fnanchor">[216]</a> of them as the first houses in Air does not
correspond with the character of the earliest ones I saw. I will
quote his exact words, as the point is important:<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> “Les premières constructions
édifiées furent Afassaz et Elnoulli; maisons à dôme central
recouvrant une grande pièce sombre entourée de nombreuses
dépendances; l’étage aujourd’hui effondré avait été solidement
étayé par des piliers de maçonnerie à large et forte structure.” To
Afassaz, a large group of villages in a valley east of Bagezan, we
will turn later; Barth erroneously supposed it lay near Towar,
having apparently confused it with Agejir. “Elnoulli” I was
entirely unable to trace under this name, and concluded that
Emululi, which is one of the Bagezan villages, was intended.</p>

<p>My interest in Tuareg architecture was first aroused near
Tabello, east of Bagezan, a point reached while I was
circumnavigating the massif. From Auderas we had been to visit
T’imia, whence we returned to the Abarakan valley. We then climbed
laboriously up the bed of the Teghazar<a id=
"FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class=
"fnanchor">[217]</a> tributary, and so reached the plateau east of
the Central massif. We camped at about 3500 feet, by the spring of
Teginjir. The water here is strongly mineralised, and comes out of
the ground at about 90° F. charged with carbonic acid gas. Within a
short distance of the spring is the volcanic crater and cone of
Gheshwa,<a id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class=
"fnanchor">[218]</a> the only recent vent which I came across in
Air. It was visited and described by Von Bary, but curiously enough
is neither referred to in other works nor shown on the Cortier map.
The cinder cone is small and rather broken down on the west side,
but the sides are still exceedingly steep and covered with loose
scoriæ. The lava flow which came out of the vent extends from the
foot of the cone, for some five miles to the south-east; it appears
to have originated in the course of a single eruption. The lava
stratum is level and about 20 feet thick, overlying the Teginjir
plain, which consists of a surface alluvium from the neighbouring
mountains, and, at one point, a disintegrating crystalline outcrop.
The lava<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> is acid
and vesicular, resembling in appearance recent flows from Vesuvius
or at Casamicciola on the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples.
The surface of the Teginjir flow proved indescribably rough and
devoid of vegetation; it has as yet had no time to disintegrate and
is undoubtedly still in the same twisted and cracked form which it
had assumed during the cooling process. E.S.E. of Mount Gheshwa are
two small black hillocks which appear to be minor cinder cones, not
connected with any lava flows. The eruption which formed the
Gheshwa cone and neighbouring lava flow is certainly posterior to
the general configuration of the plateau and is a most recent
geological phenomenon, but I found no tradition among the natives
of any volcanic activity within living memory.</p>
<p>The ground drains eastward from Teginjir along the southern side
of the T’imia massif to the Anfissak valley, named after the
buttress hills which form the south-east corner of this group. East
of Anfissak the plain extends towards and beyond Mount Mari in the
north; a number of hillocks litter the plain to the south. The
caravan road from Tripoli to the Sudan runs down this plain by the
Adoral valley past Mari well, which is now filled in, by Anfissak
well, and by Adaudu and the Tebernit water-holes to Beughqot.
Thence it goes due south to Tergulawen and over the Azawagh to
Damergu and Nigeria.</p>
<p>A short distance to the south the Anfissak valley changes its
name to Tamanet, so called after a watering-place which we reached
in one day’s march from Teginjir. At least it was meant to be a
watering-point, but we found that insufficient rain had fallen that
year in Eastern Air and there was no water in the sand of the
valley bed. We camped and left next day on a short ration of water
over one of the most difficult parts of Air which I encountered in
the whole of my journey. The plain is not boldly accidentated, but
the valleys have cut deep into the disintegrating plateau. Their
sides are steep and the flat places between them are so thickly
covered with boulders that the area is almost impossible
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> cross. We
eventually reached the Tebernit<a id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> valley just above Adaudu
and sent camels up the valley to find water at a point called
Emilía on the way to Ajiru. Our supply had completely run out. It
was thirsty work waiting for the watering party to return, and
one’s worst apprehensions were of course aroused. I prowled about
to relieve the tedium, and found a place where a ridge of rock
crossed the bed or channel of the valley. I began digging in the
sand to find water, for it seemed a likely place for an “Ers,” as
there was an old village site near by. Sure enough I found water
about two feet down, and everyone cheered up, as the Emilía party
was not due back for several hours. The place became known to the
expedition as “Rodd’s Ers.”</p>
<p>Marching from here to Tabello was light work; we camped in the
valley where the Arakieta tributary comes down from Bagezan near a
small hut village, and then made an easy stage to the rendezvous of
the salt caravan. The valley known as Tabello we discovered to be
the upper part of the Beughqot: it was another example of the
confusing habit of giving a multitude of names to a single system.
Each section bears a different name to which a traveller, according
to where he happens to be, may refer. The Ajiru, Tellia, Tebernit
and Afasas are really the same valley; similarly the Telezu,
Tokede, Towar, Tessuma and Etaras are another, while the Abarakan,
T’imilen, Agerzan, Bilasicat, Azar and Anu Maqaran are also one and
the same watercourse.</p>
<p>The country east of Bagezan now belongs to the Kel Owi
confederation. The northern part of the plain is the country of the
Kel Azañieres, but before their advent the Immikitan came as far
south as Tamanet. The Kel Anfissak, living presumably at Barth’s
well of Albes, are a Kel Azañieres sub-tribe. Ajiru was the home of
Belkho and the head-quarters of the Igermaden; but Tabello belonged
to the Igademawen. It was at Ajiru that Von Bary was
detained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> as a
virtual prisoner by Belkho until he decided to abandon his
projected journey to the Sudan.</p>
<p>The countryside had evidently at one time been quite thickly
inhabited, but presumably before the immigration of the Kel Owi,
for nearly all the ruined villages contained a characteristic type
of house, which every Tuareg agreed was built by the Itesan, who of
course came to Air long before the Kel Owi. In the Beughqot valley
where it is called Tabello a great deal of water is available all
the year round in the sand, and consequently several villages
sprang up on both banks. The largest group, which will be described
in detail, is the northernmost on the west bank, called Tasawat.
The houses here are all of the characteristic “old type,” which is
culturally far the most advanced dwelling in Air. Many of the
buildings here are very well preserved except for the roof, which
in almost every instance has collapsed. In the Tabello houses the
walls are for the most part well preserved, but elsewhere in Air
the constructional material was less good, for little remains of
the oldest type dwellings but the ground plan.</p>
<p>The oldest houses, which I will call the “A type,” are
rectangular in plan and have two rooms, a larger one with two or
three outer doors, and an inner one with one door in the partition
wall and no outer doors. All the houses of this type and most of
the later houses in Air are oriented in the same direction, namely,
within a few degrees of north and south, with the smaller room at
the northern end. There were a few exceptions in the fourth group
which I examined at Tabello; they were houses on a N.N.W.-S.S.E.
line, or oriented E.-W. with the small room at the west end. The
latter is an interesting point, because although the Air dialect of
Temajegh contains a proper word for north (“tasalgi”), the word for
west (“ataram”), which in some other dialects of the language has
acquired the significance of north, is also sometimes used for this
cardinal point.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>The big rooms of these “A type” houses in all the village groups
examined varied but little in size, the largest one I<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> measured being 29 ft. × 14 ft.
inside. The small rooms varied rather more, ranging between 9 ft.
and 12 ft. in length, the breadth being the same as for the big
room. The head room was in all cases remarkable, one house I
measured being as much as 12 ft. from the floor to the underside of
the dûm palm rafters of the roof. In every instance the height was
more than sufficient for a man to stand upright, a feature which
does not obtain in the later houses. The large room was usually
provided with three doors, the east and west ones being of similar
dimensions, the south door rather smaller. In two cases in one
group at Tabello and in other instances in the north I noticed that
the east doors of the old houses had small buttresses outside as if
to enhance their importance, though in one house the east door had
been reduced to a small aperture; but this was exceptional.
Buttresses were not observed on any of the west doors. In two cases
I noticed here there was no south door, an omission which also
occurred elsewhere among the later houses. The east and west doors,
varying slightly according to the size of the house, were 4 ft. or
more in height by 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. in breadth. In all the
Tabello houses the door openings were recessed on the inner side to
take a removable wooden door some ten inches broader and taller
than the opening itself. The recess was continued for a sufficient
space laterally to allow the frame to be pushed to one side without
taking up room space. One side of the recess was provided with an
elbow-hole in the outer wall of the house about 2 ft. from the
ground for access to a latch for securing the door frame. In the
later houses, but not at Tabello, the sliding frame door gave place
to one swinging from stone sockets in the threshold and lintel;
these doors are in some cases over 3 ft. broad and cut out of one
piece of wood: they also were provided with a latch or bolt fitting
into a catch in the inner part of the elbow-hole by which the door
was secured and sometimes locked with a rough padlock of Tripolitan
or Algerian manufacture. No doubt the door frames of the earlier
houses were provided with a similar latch and lock, but
none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> of the
woodwork has survived. The neatness of design of the sliding door
recess was particularly striking in these dwellings.</p>
<p>The threshold of the doors in the older houses was on the floor
level, which was a few inches above the outside level. The larger
rooms had quadrangular niches of different dimensions at odd points
in the walls, as well as certain peculiar and characteristic niches
in the partition walls. The inner rooms were provided with small
niches made of pots built into the walls; in many cases there were
four shelves across the corners some 3-4 ft. from the ground made
of heavy beams, evidently intended to carry considerable weights.
The surfaces of these shelves, like all the inner walls of both
rooms, were carefully plastered with mud mortar whitened or
coloured with earths similar to those used in the washes on houses
at Agades. In one case a dado or wainscot of a different colour had
been applied with a finger-drawn zigzag border of another shade.
The stucco surfaces were brown, earthy crimson, ochre, yellow or
white.</p>
<p>One characteristic feature was observed in all the “old type”
houses which still had walls standing of sufficient height for
something more than the mere ground plan to be seen. On either side
of the doorway in the partition or north wall of the large room
there was a niche of very peculiar shape. The top was rather like a
Gothic arch, and a recess was cut out in the base. The niches and
the door in some cases were ornamented with an elaborate border, in
other cases they were entirely unadorned. The shape of the niche,
however, was constant and the size generally uniform. The style of
decoration will be seen in Plates <a href="#i29a">29</a> and
<a href="#i30">30.</a></p>
<p>The later houses in Air are clearly an adaptation of the earlier
type, for they have many common characteristics. These houses I
have called the “B type” to distinguish them from the “A” or
“Itesan type.” The “B houses” also are rectangular but
single-roomed; for the most part they too are oriented north and
south. An Imajegh whom I questioned on this point at Iferuan said
he did not know why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
this was so, but that all the correct houses of nobles were built
in this manner, including the one in which his own family had
always lived. He added that the three usual outside doors were
called Imi n’Innek, the Door of the East, the Imi n’Aghil, the Door
of the South, but the west door, instead of being called the Imi
n’Ataram, was called the Imi n’Tasalgi, which properly means the
Door of the North. When I asked him to explain this curious fact,
he told me that it was because the Tuareg came from there, a
statement which seemed inadequate, albeit significant. The
confusion of west and north is especially curious; and the
explanation of the house oriented E. and W. at Tabello is probably
due to a misunderstanding on this point in the mind of the early
builder. The problem is not unconnected with the varying sense of
the word Ataram. Analogies between the “A” and “B” types of house
are not, however, confined to those peculiarities of orientation
and doors. A door in the north wall of the “B type” houses is very
rare; on the other hand, in the majority of examples of this type I
noticed that there was a long, very low niche on that side of the
room. These recesses were not more than four or five inches high by
eighteen to twenty-four inches long; they were used for keeping the
Holy Books in and for no other purpose. The position of these
niches, it is true, was not absolutely constant, nor was the type
of niche for the Holy Books in the north walls always that shape,
but the conclusion I reached from their frequent occurrence was
that they in some way correspond to the ogive niches of the earlier
houses, which I conceive had an indisputably ritual or religious
significance. In a “B type” house at Assarara in Northern Air I
came across two rectangular niches in a west wall which were
obviously developments of the ornamented ogive niches of the “A
type” house, and may also have been used for Holy Books, but this
example of displacement with the varying and fortuitous practices
adopted in the later dwellings convinced me that the use which had
prescribed the earlier fashion was in process of being forgotten as
modern times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> were
approached, and that no explanation was therefore likely to be
obtained by consulting local learned men. In the “B type” houses,
as in the earlier dwellings, there was usually a profusion of other
niches in the walls serving different household purposes.</p>
<p>The niches and the style of ornamentation of the “A type” houses
of Air occur in the Sudan, but the formality of planning, the
constant orientation and the ritualistic properties of the
recesses, so far as I know, have no analogies outside Tuareg lands.
I am not aware that attention has hitherto been drawn to these
points either in the accounts of Air prepared by the French or in
descriptions of dwellings in other parts of Africa, with the
exception of one reference in Richardson’s account of his travels
in 1845-6 in the Fezzan. He describes the houses at Ghat as having
niches, and, from sketches he made, some of them are evidently of
the same type as those in the Air houses of the first period.<a id=
"FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class=
"fnanchor">[220]</a> They afford a problem which requires
elucidation and which might throw much light on the cultural
contacts of the Tuareg, among whom they seem to be traditional.</p>

<p>The constant type of the houses, despite their disparity of
date, is so marked that it cannot be fortuitous. I examined in the
course of my stay in Air the villages and towns of Auderas, Towar,
Agejir, the Tabello and Afassaz-Tebernit groups, T’imia, Assode,
T’in Wansa, Igululof, Anu Samed, T’intaghoda, Tanutmolet, Iferuan,
Seliufet, Agellal, Tefis and Anu Wisheran, and found the “A” and “B
types” or their derivatives predominant to an extent which made it
quite clear that some fundamental principle was involved in their
construction. The earlier houses betray so highly developed a
technique of building that we are clearly concerned with the
remnants of a far higher cultural state than that which the Tuareg
now possess. I say “remnants” advisedly, for since the date of the
“A type” dwellings there has been a progressive deterioration in
the art of construction. Technically, in Air, what is best is
earliest. The first houses<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> of the Tuareg were obviously planned and
executed with care. The walls, where still standing, measured about
2 ft. 9 in. to 3 ft. at the base, tapering 9 to 12 in. to the top.
The inside faces were perpendicular, all the taper being on the
outside, where it is clearly visible in the profiles of the
corners. The outsides of the walls were roughly faced with mud
stucco; the insides were more carefully plastered to produce a very
smooth surface, which in the best houses appears to have been
procured with a board; hand marks on the plaster surface seemed
rare. The dûm palm rafters of the roofs, door lintels and tops of
recesses were carefully placed so that any curve of the wood was
upward in order to give as much height as possible. The most
noticeable feature in the construction of the “A type” houses was
certainly the squareness and accuracy of the corners, which were
sharp and cleanly finished. The later houses were less carefully
executed and the corners, instead of being square, were rounded
both within and without. The walls were less perpendicular and
straight, the rectangular planning was sometimes out of true, the
stucco-work, while better conserved on the outer walls owing to
their more recent date, was manifestly rougher; there was often,
nay usually, hardly room to stand upright inside the
dwelling.<a id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class=
"fnanchor">[221]</a></p>
<p>The constructional material of both types of house was observed
to vary very much according to the supplies available on the spot.
Small stones up to six inches long set in mud mortar are generally
used. The coursing of the stones was carefully levelled, and in the
“A type” very regular; a deterioration was seen in the later
dwellings. The influence of the Sudanese style of construction is
reflected in one or two houses at Tabello, where dried mud cakes
have been used instead of stones; but even in these cases the mud
cakes have been used like stones, set in mud mortar, levelled and
regularly coursed, and contrasting with the more irregular methods
of the Southland. Generally speaking<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_250">[250]</span> the numbers of “A” and “B type” houses in
Air built only of mud seemed exceedingly small. In the stone, as in
the mud constructions, some re-surfacing every year after the rains
must have been inevitable.</p>
<p>The roofs are made of palm fronds, brushwood and mud mortar with
a low parapet around the edge, and often with six pinnacles,
respectively at the four corners and half-way along the longest
sides.</p>
<p>The ruins of the “A type” houses at Tabello and Afasas were
nearly always surrounded by other derelict buildings within an
enclosure of large stones marking a sort of compound. The
enclosures were not formal; they sometimes surrounded the whole
house, sometimes only one side. The outhouses in the compound had
no particular character: they were storehouses or the dwellings of
the slaves. The buildings were as formless as the main houses were
formal: they were either one-roomed or many-chambered with or
without inter-communicating doors. They rarely adjoined the “A
type” buildings, and were invariably more roughly constructed, many
more of them being built of mud. In the “B type” settlements one
was struck with the greater absence of outhouses and enclosing
walls. Where subsidiary dwellings existed there had been a tendency
to build them on to the main dwelling. A large number of both “A”
and “B” houses in the Ighazar had wooden porches or shelters
outside the east door, and were surrounded by a sort of wooden
fence or stockade.</p>
<p>Such are the two most characteristic types of house in Air.
Other forms of dwellings I will refer to as the “C,” “D” and “E
types.” The last-named “E type” can be disposed of immediately, for
it is of no particular interest in connection with the Tuareg.
<a href="#i28">Plate 28</a> gives the plan of one such a house
formerly inhabited by Fugda, chief of T’imia, before the
inhabitants moved to the present village and lived in huts. It is
characteristic of the Southland both in design and construction,
and, like all the recent “E type” houses, was built of mud.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>The “D type” is
a many-roomed dwelling, apparently occupied by several families.
The largest example I saw was at Tabello. The plan is given on
<a href="#i28">Plate 28.</a> In this case the construction was of
stone and mud, but principally of the former. The technique was
very inferior; several periods of construction were observable. The
individual dwellings in this group were apparently at least four,
consisting of areas numbered in the plan 1 to 7, 8 to 10, 13 to 17,
and 20 to 26, respectively. Areas numbered 4, 9, 21, 22 and 24 were
courtyards, the entrance to 21 having holes in the wall for wooden
bars, and being apparently designed as a cattle-pen. The group had
at least one well in area 16, and possibly another one in 12,
though the latter might only have been a grain-pit. Another example
of the “D type” house situated in the Afassaz valley group is given
on <a href="#i28">Plate 28.</a> It lay at the foot of a rock,
beneath which there is a permanent water-hole in the sand. A few
hundred yards away was a village of “A type” houses. Along the
valley in the same vicinity were enclosures of dry stone walls on
the tops of the hills bordering the valley. I hazard a conclusion
that these “D type” dwellings were used by the inhabitants of the
area when the larger settlements were abandoned by the Itesan and
Kel Geres in their move westward as a result of raiding from the
east.<a id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class=
"fnanchor">[222]</a> The “D type” dwelling is a semi-fortified
work, or at least a defensible building where several families who
had remained in a dangerous area might congregate for safety in
times of trouble. These dwellings with the hill-top enclosures
along the Afassaz valley are the nearest approach to fortifications
which I discovered in Air.</p>
<p>The last type of house to be described represents a later
development of the “A type.” The “C type” houses retain many of the
characteristics of the earlier buildings, and although it is not
always easy to date them, their preservation indicates that they
are more recent. The rectangular formality of the earlier type
survived but the orientation has been lost. The technique in many
cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> is better
than in the “B type”; but the ogive niches are absent and the
interior stucco-work was often very rough. The various forms which
the plan may take are given in Plates <a href="#i29a">29</a> and
<a href="#i30">30.</a> Some of the “C type” houses belong to the
Itesan period and are descended from the “A type” building, while
some of them are certainly late Kel Owi houses. The town of Agejir,
north of Towar, from which the plans on <a href="#i27">Plate 27</a>
are taken was an Itesan settlement, probably founded when these
tribes moved away from the plain east of Bagezan. Here I found only
one true “A type” house, but as there must be over 300 ruined
houses, I may well have missed many more. The state of the
buildings here was very bad owing to the lack of good mud mortar,
which has preserved those at Tabello. The better houses at Agejir
seemed to fall into two categories: the one a single-roomed
structure of about 20 ft. × 10 ft. internal dimensions, having
usually two doors in the centre of the longest or east and west
sides; the other a two-roomed structure. In the latter, the larger
room was about the same size as in the single-roomed dwellings, the
smaller room being about 10 ft. × 7 ft.; the common wall was not
pierced, which may have been due to the use of inferior building
materials. All the other buildings at Agejir were formless
quadrangular structures, but the two types described are clearly
descended directly from the “A type” house.</p>
<p>Of the three villages at Towar, the modern one is a collection
of mud huts; the older site on the same bank is a group of
single-roomed “B type” houses, while the oldest of the three
settlements is on the west bank and is called the Itesan village.
Among the twenty ruined houses which I examined there I found three
very good examples of the “A type,” correctly oriented north and
south, in addition to several others of the single-roomed variety,
the better ones being similar to those at Agejir. The 100 odd
houses on this site were in too ruinous a condition to be readily
identifiable.</p>
<p>The houses in Northern and North-eastern Air will be described
in a succeeding chapter, but the subject cannot here<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> be left without reference to
certain dwellings which I encountered at Faodet at the head of the
Ighazar basin. Here, side by side with some ordinary “B type”
dwellings, were a few straw and thatch huts of about the same size
constructed on a rectangular plan in obvious imitation of the
neighbouring masonry dwellings. They were correctly oriented and
had flat thatched roofs. Their inhabitants, though using an
unsuitable material, had evidently tried to construct that type of
dwelling which they felt was more correct for permanent occupation
than the temporary round huts, a more suitable shape, of course,
for brushwood, grass and matting construction. This example of
innate sense of formality is most significant.</p>
<p>It is possible to draw certain conclusions on the style of
Tuareg house construction in Air, even without the material
evidence necessary for a more detailed study or comparative dating.
Could excavation be undertaken, information would not be lacking,
for pottery and stratified débris abound, only, unfortunately, time
was not available for such investigations in the course of my
journey.</p>
<p>The “A type” houses, according to the unanimous tradition of the
present inhabitants, were built by the Itesan. Their vicarious
distribution in Air suggests that all the Tuareg of the first wave
used this style of dwelling. That fewer have survived in areas from
which they were dispossessed by the Kel Geres and Kel Owi is
natural. It is not, therefore, fortuitous that the present Tuareg
call the houses Itesan rather than Kel Geres, despite the later
association of the two groups of people; whatever claim has been
put forward on behalf of the latter for a share in the earlier
architectural development I am inclined to regard as simply due to
their comparatively recent historical association. The later
immigrants do not appear to have been so troubled by traditions of
the formality which imbued their predecessors. In the essentially
Kel Geres areas west of the Iferuan-Auderas-Agades road, other than
the part which the Itesan occupied astride the line in the Auderas
area,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> the “A type”
houses occur, but are rare. The “B” and transitional “C types,”
predominate. Nevertheless these Kel Geres “B type” houses are
larger and better in technical execution than the late “B type,”
which are known to have been made and used by the Kel Owi. The
latter in their dwellings display a more formal conception than the
Kel Geres; many of the old characteristics, like orientation,
arrangements of the doors, ritual niches and proportion come out
more strongly in North-eastern Air than, for instance, in the
Agellal and Sidawet areas. The formless quadrangular buildings of
Assode with very few of the old peculiarities are apparently Kel
Geres work. The influence of the first or Itesan immigrants was,
however, still sufficiently powerful to render their technique of
construction in many respects superior to that of the Kel Owi.</p>
<p>The persistence of the characteristics of the Itesan period
among the later Kel Owi, in fact its existence till quite recently
among all the Air Tuareg in one form or another, is proof that we
are not concerned with any fortuitous manifestation. Both the
sentiments held by the people to-day and the occurrence of
rectangular straw huts on the “B type” plan at Faodet, substantiate
this conclusion. But if I am right in my feeling that the
characteristics in question were more strongly present among the
first Itesan or Kel Innek wave and among the third or Kel Owi wave
than among the Kel Geres, then the explanation is tenable that the
features are derived from the civilisation of the Lemta or
Fezzanian branch of the Tuareg, who, we shall see, are the original
stock from which the first and last wave of immigrants into Air
were probably derived, the former by way of the Chad countries, the
latter also from the north or north-west, but perhaps by way of the
Adghar of the Ifoghas and Tademekka.<a id=
"FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class=
"fnanchor">[223]</a> This line of reasoning, which is put forward
very tentatively, indicates that the Fezzan requires to be examined
in some detail before an advance in the solution of the problem
surrounding the cultural origin<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_255">[255]</span> of the Air house can be made. Even if the
evidence of their houses were all, I should be satisfied that the
culture of the Air Tuareg was a shadowy memory of some higher
civilisation. I will hazard no guess regarding its first cradle,
but only suggest that some clues may be found in the Fezzan.</p>
<p>Another aspect of Tuareg architecture in Air remains to be
examined. It concerns the style of their mosques. These buildings
are comparatively numerous and all on much the same plan. The
simplest form is a long, narrow construction running north and
south with a “Qibla” in the centre of the east side. It is
noteworthy that in several cases the “Qibla” gives the impression
of having been added to the building, after the main walls had been
erected, but this may only be an illusion due to defective
workmanship. The larger mosques have one or more “aisles,” the wall
or walls between them being pierced at many points to give the
illusion of columns supporting the low roof. With the exception of
one at Agejir, the head room of all the mosques I examined never
exceeded 6 feet. Even the mosque at Assode, which was the largest
in Air, had so low a ceiling that it was scarcely possible to stand
upright anywhere inside. In one or two examples which I saw there
was a separate construction, consisting of a single or double
“aisle,” standing some feet away, west of the mosque proper. These
buildings were of the same dimensions from north to south as the
latter and served as alms-houses or “khans” for the distribution of
food to the poor, who were also allowed to sleep there when
travelling from village to village. In the mosque of Assode and in
that of Tasawat in the Tabello group of villages certain portions
of the sacred building were reserved for the worship of women, or
as schools. In the Tasawat mosque the windows of the “harim”
enclosure looked into the main part of the mosque, but had lattice
gratings of split palm fronds crossing one another diagonally. This
mosque was certainly later than any of the “A type” houses in the
vicinity. Its construction<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_256">[256]</span> was indifferent, but noteworthy for the
elaboration of the holes pierced in the partition walls, every
alternate one being shaped like the ogive niches in the partition
walls of the “A type” houses with the same recess cut out of the
base. Neither in these openings nor in the niches of the houses has
the principle of the true arch been applied: the ogives were built
up by a wooden cantilever framing set in the thickness of the
walls. With the exception of the great mosque at Agades, which is
of the same type as the other holy buildings in Air, Assode is the
only example which possessed a minaret. It is curious that the
early houses of the Tuareg should be so noteworthy for the height
of the roof, while the mosques should be equally remarkable for the
lowness; the feature is one associated with a late period of
building.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to date any of the mosques, or indeed any
of the other buildings or graves in Air, absolutely, in the absence
of archæological field evidence. Jean<a id=
"FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class=
"fnanchor">[224]</a> has collected a tradition to the effect that
the mosque of Tefis is the oldest in Air, and this accords with my
information. He dates it, however, at 1150 years ago, and states
that it was built by the Kel Geres, who, according to him, were the
first Tuareg to reach Air. Though I cannot agree with the last part
of this conclusion, I concur in finding that the Kel Geres were the
first Tuareg to enter Air by the north, and that they were,
therefore, perhaps responsible for the introduction of Islam into
the country. If this should prove to be the case, it is indeed
probable that they built the first mosques. But Jean’s acceptance
of the traditional dating of the mosques is closely connected with
the dates which he assigns to the advent of the Tuareg, namely, the
eighth century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>, a period which for
reasons given elsewhere I am inclined to consider too early.</p>
<p>The traditional date for the founding of the mosque at Tefis in
the eighth century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> is hardly
admissible, for it is more than doubtful whether Islam had spread
so far south by that time. It is alternatively uncertain whether a
Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> Church
then existed in the land. By the year 800 <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> Islam had only penetrated Tripolitania and
Tunisia to a limited extent and in the face of much opposition
which persisted for long. Jean’s dates must be regarded, not as
absolute, but only as indicating a chronological sequence. The
second mosque according to him was founded at T’intaghoda fifty
years after the one at Tefis. The building, he states, was made by
the Kel Owi, but if they were responsible for its construction the
date must be set down as much later. My information agrees with its
having been the second mosque in Air to be built; and this much of
Jean’s information I accept, but discard its Kel Owi origin.<a id=
"FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class=
"fnanchor">[225]</a> The third mosque was built at Assode about 100
years later than Tefis. The one at Agades followed after an
interval of 40 years, 980 years ago, and is said to have been
offered to the second Sultan of Agades as a present from the
tribes. Chudeau adds to this information the additional detail that
the minaret of the mosque of Assode, which, according to him, was
1000 years old, fell four centuries ago, but as the débris has not
been cleared away to this day, the accuracy of the statement seems
doubtful. Both Chudeau’s and Jean’s dates are all too remote. Undue
importance must not be attached to the round figures in which the
Tuareg are prone to reckon their traditional history.</p>

<p>The etymology given by the Arabs to the word “tarki” or
“tawarek,” even if not strictly accurate, indicates that the People
of the Veil adopted the Faith of Islam long after the other
inhabitants of North Africa. When they did so, they appear to have
been lukewarm converts and to have retained many practices which
the Prophet directed good Moslems to abhor. At Ghat, which was ever
under their influence and where numbers of them have always lived,
the tradition of their recent conversion may be found in the
two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> parts of the
town, known as the Quarter of Yes and the Quarter of No, from the
people who accepted or refused Islam. At so late a period as when
the Kel Owi arrived at the end of the seventeenth century
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> the Kel Ferwan whom they drove out of
the Iferuan valley in Northern Air were still “heathen,” though we
are not told what their religion was. A very early date for the
mosques of Air is therefore inherently improbable even if the Kel
Geres did found Tefis as the first permanent place of worship for
the new Faith. Assuming that the Kel Geres came to Air in the
eleventh or twelfth century, the foundation of T’intaghoda mosque
some 400 years later is not improbable; and it is not wholly
impossible to reconcile such a date with the implications involved
in the story of the gift of the mosque of Agades to the second
Sultan of Air, who, we believe, reigned half-way through the
fifteenth century. I prefer to consider that the mosques as a whole
are not very old. Their style of construction demonstrates them to
be more recent than the “A type” houses, though admittedly this
view might have to be altered in the event of excavations providing
additional or contradictory evidence.</p>
<p>Apart from the numerous places of prayer marked by a “Qibla” of
a few stones laid on the surface of the ground or by a
quadrilateral enclosure of small stones, I only came across one
site which might have been a pre-Moslem place of worship adapted to
the later Faith. In the upper part of the River of Agades, on the
south shore below the cliffs, at the entrance of the gulf where the
Akaraq valley joins it, there is a square enclosure marked by what
looks like the remains of a wall of which only the foundations on
the ground level survive. The walls may never at any time have been
more than a few inches high; what remains is of stones set in mud
cement. At each of the four corners of the square there was a large
stone. The four sides, each of some 15 ft. long, were true and
square and oriented on the cardinal points. The enclosure was
obviously not that of a hut, nor like the ground-plan of any of the
houses in Air. In the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_259">[259]</span> centre of the eastern side at a later
period two standing stones had been set up. The stones were fossil
trees, some other fragments of which were lying loose on the top of
the neighbouring cliff. They had obviously been brought by human
agency, as curious or interesting stones, from another place at no
very remote period.<a id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226"
class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The two standing stones were about 2 ft.
6 in. apart. They were intended to mark the east, but were quite
clearly later additions to the place, for they were merely
standing, and not built into, the foundation of the enclosure. They
were not even symmetrical or exactly in the centre of the side. The
enclosure may, I think, be regarded as a pre-Moslem place of
worship and not merely as a dwelling-house, because the “Qibla”
pillars of an Islamic place of prayer could as readily have been
set up elsewhere, had there not been a deliberate design to convert
a site from one religious use to another. Its form does not
resemble that of any of the usual buildings of Air. In the vicinity
was a group of graves, some of which were circular enclosures,
while others, obviously more recent in date, were oblong and
correctly oriented from the Moslem point of view.</p>
<p>The graves and tombs of Air might well form the object of
interesting archæological excavation. Many of them display an
indubitably non-Moslem appearance. The most common type which
continues throughout the period of Tuareg occupation in one form or
another is a ring of stones set on edge around a raised area
covered with small white pebbles. The grave is too low to be termed
a tumulus or mound, it is convex or shaped like an inverted saucer,
but the centre rises only a few inches above the surrounding
ground. The ring of stones may be roughly circular, oval or
elliptical. In the Moslem period the graves are definitely oblong,
the major axis being directed north and south, in order that the
body may be placed in the grave with the head turned towards the
east. The older graves were the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_260">[260]</span> round, or elliptical enclosures, the latter
with no fixed orientation; the earlier they are the more nearly
circular they seem to be. This is especially noticeable in the case
of the graves near, and probably contemporary with, the “A type”
houses at Tabello. A large central circular grave is often
surrounded by smaller oval ones lying in any direction, clustering
about a more important burial.</p>
<p>The later Moslem graves are smaller, but the practice of
covering the surface with white pebbles or chips of quartz
continues. The shape becomes narrower, less circular and more
inclined to turn into a rectangle. The appearance of head-stones or
head and feet stones, which the Arabs call “The Witnesses,”
coincides with correct Moslem orientation, but even in modern times
it is rare to find any inscription. The few I saw were rough
scratchings in Arabic script and sometimes, in T’ifinagh, of some
simple name like “Muhammad” or “Ahmed.” I only saw one instance, at
Afis, of an inscription of any length; it recorded the interment of
a notable sheikh, and was scored with a pointed tool on a potsherd.
Neither in the houses nor in the graves of Air is there any
evidence of the Tuareg having attempted to cut stone. Even the
petroglyphs are hammered and scratched but not chiselled.</p>
<p>A great deal has been written about the funerary monuments of
North Africa known as the “argem.”<a id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> They are found in many
parts of the Northern Sahara, in the Ahnet mountains and the Adghar
n’Ifoghas, and in the Nigerian Sudan, but not in Tuat. They have
been reported in the Azger Tassili, at In Azawa on the north road
from Air and at several points in Air. Bates reports them in the
Gulf of Bomba and in the Nubian cemeteries of Upper Egypt.<a id=
"FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class=
"fnanchor">[228]</a></p>
<p>They are enclosures of piled stones varying in shape from round
to square, but generally the former; or they take the form of
tumuli containing a cist or tomb. In certain cases the graves are
described as surrounded by concentric circles<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_261">[261]</span> of stones. The distribution of these
“argem” recalls immediately the geographical situation of the
Tuareg. It would be easy to assume that their existence was due to
this people, were it not for the difficulty that the monuments all
appear quite late in date. To quote Gautier<a id=
"FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class=
"fnanchor">[229]</a>: “En résumé la question des monuments
rupestres du Sahara, funéraires et religieux, semble élucidée, au
moins dans ses grandes lignes. Le problème d’ailleurs, tel qu’il se
pose actuellement, et sous réserve de découvertes ultérieures, est
remarquablement simple. En autres pays, en particulier dans les
provinces voisines d’Algérie et du Soudan, le passé préhistorique
se présente sous des aspects multiples. En Algérie les redjems
abondent, mais on trouve à côté d’eux des dolmens, quelques
sépultures sous roche, pour rien dire des Puniques et Romaines. Au
Soudan, comme on peut s’y attendre, en un pays où tant de races
sont juxtaposées, le livre de M. Desplagnes énumère des tombeaux de
types divers et multiples, poterie, grottes sépulcrales, cases
funéraires, tumulus.<a id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Rien de pareil au
Sahara. On distingue bien des types différents de redjem, les
caveaux sous tumulus du nord qui sont peut-être influencés par les
dolmens et sépultures romaines, les redjems à soutaches du Tassili
des Azguers, les chouchets du Hogar qui semblent nous raconter
l’itinéraire et l’expansion des nobles Touaregs actuels. . . .
Parmi tant de pierres sahariennes entassées ou agencées par
l’homme, on n’en connaît pas une seule qu’on peut soupçonner de
l’avoir été par une autre main que Berbère.” But here the
difficulty appears, for “ceci nous conduirait à conclure que les
Berbères ont habité le Sahara dans toute l’étendue du passé
historique et préhistorique si d’autre part tous ces redjems ne
paraissaient récents. . . . Les mobiliers funéraires contiennent du
fer, et on n’en connaît pas un seul qui soit purement et
authentiquement néolithique. Cette énorme lacune est naturellement
de nature à nous inspirer la plus grande prudence dans nos
conclusions. D’autant plus<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_262">[262]</span> que, après tout, les monuments similaires
algériens, dans l’état actuel de nos connaissances, ne paraissent
pas plus anciens.”</p>
<p>While the distribution of “argem” seems then to coincide with,
and be due to the Tuareg, the “Berbères” to whom Gautier refers
arrived in North Africa and spread into the interior before the
advent of the metal ages. The last word has certainly not been said
regarding the age of these monuments, and in spite of this
difficulty of dates I have little hesitation in finding in them
evidence of the individuality and racial detachment of the Tuareg
stock from that of the other Libyans, who do not seem to have used
this funerary apparatus. After all, the late neolithic and early
metal ages in inner Libya were hardly separate from one another,
and in the south, where we know the Tuareg are only fairly recent
arrivals, the lateness of the “argem” is readily understandable.
But if we believe them to be due to the Tuareg, the earliest
remains in the north must be far older than Gautier supposes.</p>
<p>Although certain remains of a presumed funerary or religious
nature in Air have been described as “argem,” it has apparently
escaped notice that both the pre-Moslem as well as the later graves
of the country are all linear descendants of the older and more
pretentious monuments. Yet if the term has any significance at all,
there has been a tendency perhaps to describe rather too many
enclosures as “argem.” Certain examples illustrated by Gautier are
probably devoid of any spiritual significance. There are in Air,
for instance, especially in the north of the country near Agwau, a
number of groups of concentric stone circles, which were simply
enclosures round temporary huts or tents. The old hut circles of
the T’imia village (<a href="#i29a">Plate 29</a>) show clearly how
an isolated example might be assumed to have been a prayer or
religious enclosure. Again, the circular heaps of stones at Elazzas
resemble the “argem” illustrated by Bates<a id=
"FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class=
"fnanchor">[231]</a> so much that one might be tempted to conclude
that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> were
such, if it did not happen to be known that they were the raised
plinths on which huts used to be constructed. A deduction drawn
from the occurrence of the latter might indicate that the origin of
the true “argem” was derived from a desire to commemorate in death
the only permanent part of a man’s hut dwelling in life. Such an
explanation is not only permissible but even probable; it is even
possible that in some cases tombs were actually made in the very
floor of the hut or side of the pedestal where the deceased had
lived.</p>
<p>In the lower Turayet valley in Southern Air I passed a number of
graves which seemed to suggest an intermediate type between the
large prehistoric “rigm” and the later small enclosure of stones
covered with white pebbles. The Turayet graves were small circular
platforms like the hut foundations at Elazzas, but not more than 10
ft. in diameter with vertical sides a few inches above the ground
level and flat tops covered with white stones. The occurrence of
these tombs on the Turayet valley, not far from the mouth of the
Akaraq valley, where also is perhaps a pre-Moslem place of worship,
and the existence of what may prove a pre-Moslem urn burial
cemetery at Marandet, all of which places are in the extreme south
of Air, are interesting points when it is remembered that the first
Tuareg inhabitants of Air came to the country from the south. It
may nevertheless be pure coincidence that there seemed to be fewer
obviously ancient monuments in Northern Air than in the southern
part.</p>
<p>The absence of funerary inscriptions is in marked contrast with
the profusion of rock writings in Air. Written literature is,
however, almost non-existent, but traditional poetry takes its
place. The esteem in which poetry is held and the popularity which
it enjoys are proof of the intellectual capacity which is present
in this people.</p>
<p>When it is realised that, alone among the ancient people of
North Africa, the Tuareg have kept an individual script, it seems
extraordinary that drawing, painting and sculpture should have
remained in so primitive a state. Even if we are to admit that the
earliest and therefore the best of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_264">[264]</span> rock drawings of North Africa are the work
of the ancestors of the Tuareg, it is hardly possible to qualify
them as more than interesting or curious. Few of them are
beautiful. Some of the “Early Period”<a id=
"FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class=
"fnanchor">[232]</a> drawings were executed with precision and
care, but even if full allowance is made for the possibility of
their having been coloured there are hardly any artistic
achievements of merit. They do not bear comparison with the bushman
drawings of South Africa, still less with the magnificent cave
paintings of the Reindeer Age in Europe. But while some doubt
exists regarding the authorship of the early drawings, the later
North African pictures can be ascribed to the Tuareg without any
fear of controversy. The Tuareg are still engaged in making them,
but this modern work is even more crude. The drawings have become
conventionalised; the symbols do not necessarily bear any likeness
to the objects which they purport to represent.</p>
<p>The rock drawings in Air display continuity from bad examples in
the style of the early period down to the modern conventionalised
glyphs. In most cases both the early and the late work is
accompanied by T’ifinagh inscriptions. The earlier drawings
represent animals which exist, or used to exist, in Air. The most
carefully executed I saw were in the valley leading up from
Agaragar to the pass into the Ighazar basin above Faodet. The place
was near some watering-point, used by the northern Salt Caravan
from Air to Bilma. The pictures were somewhat difficult to see as
they had in part been covered by later drawings. The execution was
rough, consisting of little more than an outline with a few
markings on the bodies of some of the animals. As in the late
petroglyphs there was no chiselling or cutting: the lines were made
by hammering with a more or less suitable instrument and then by
rubbing with a stone and sand. Among the animals thus represented,
the giraffe and the ostrich in a wild state survive south of Air.
An antelope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> with
sloping quarters and large lyre-shaped horns, the ox, the camel,
the donkey, a horse, a large bird, and the human figure, both male
and female, could also be traced. The large antelope I cannot
identify for certain, but the large bird is probably the Greater
Arab Bustard.</p>
<p>In the later work the conventionalised symbols remain fairly
constant. The ox is shown as a straight line with four vertical
lines representing legs, a clear indication of the hump, and two
short horns. The rectangular camel symbol had become so debased
that for a long time I was at a loss to interpret it. The
representations of the human figure are only curious inasmuch as
they emphasise the long robe worn by the Tuareg and sometimes the
cross bands over the breast, so typical of the Libyans in the
Egyptian paintings. An interesting point in these rudimentary
examples of the pictorial art is that even in the early period they
portray a similar fauna and habit of life to those of to-day. A
faint Egyptian influence may be detected in the human figures. I
know of no drawings in Air to compare with the ones found by Barth
at Telizzarhen, nor any which appeared to have a religious
significance. The most interesting example is certainly that of the
ox and cart referred to in the following chapter.</p>
<p>The necessity of pictorial expression was evidently less felt
than that of poetry, a condition to which nomadism has undoubtedly
contributed. Yet even in ornament and draughtsmanship the Tuareg
seem once to have reached a higher plane of civilisation in the
past than that which they now possess and which their life has led
them progressively to abandon.</p>
<p>They have little knowledge of history outside their own tribal
or group lore with the exception of that modicum of knowledge
derived from a superficial study of the Quran. At the same time,
men like Ahodu have heard and remembered stories of the past such
as those of Kahena, Queen of the Aures, and of her fighting against
the Arabs. Their knowledge of local geography is enormous, of the
general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> form or
shape of North Africa small. They know of the Mediterranean and
their language has a word for the sea. They have heard of the Nile,
of Egypt, of the Niger and of Lake Chad, but they have only very
vague inklings of the existence of Arabia or of the whereabouts of
Istambul, where the Defender of the Faith lived. They can draw
rough maps of local features on the sand and understand perfectly
the conception of European maps on a wider scale. When I showed
them an atlas with a map of the world and laboriously explained
that it was a flat representation of a spherical object, Ahodu and
Sidi surprised me by saying that they knew that the world was
round, and that if you went in by a hole you would eventually come
out on the other side. Duveyrier and others have been surprised at
the knowledge of European countries and politics which they have
found in the Sahara. The communication of news between distant
parts of Africa is highly developed and at times astounding.</p>

<p class="cpm">TIFINAGH ALPHABET</p>
<a href="images/i33_large.jpg"><img src='images/i33.jpg' alt=
''></a></figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>If only on account of their script the Tuareg have deserved more
attention in this country than they have received. I have no
intention at this juncture of examining either T’ifinagh or
Temajegh in detail, as they require study in a volume dedicated to
them alone; but, as an ancient non-Arabic script which has survived
in Africa, I cannot refrain from a brief description of the former.
T’ifinagh is an alphabetic and not a syllabic script, but owing to
the abbreviations practised in writing and the absence of all
vowels except an A which resembles the Hamza or Alif, it has come
to resemble a sort of shorthand. It is usually necessary to know
the general meaning of any writing before it can be read. The
T’ifinagh alphabet consists of between thirty and forty symbols
varying somewhat from place to place. Duveyrier<a id=
"FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class=
"fnanchor">[233]</a> collected an alphabet of twenty-three letters
used in the north: Hanoteau,<a id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> who wrote the best
grammar of Temajegh yet published, gives twenty-four letters:
Masquerey<a id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class=
"fnanchor">[235]</a> gives twenty-three letters for the Taitoq
dialect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> and script:
Freeman found twenty-five in the Ghadamsi Tuareg dialects. In
addition to these letter symbols there are about twelve ligatures
of two or sometimes three letters. All these signs are used in Air,
but there are also certain additional symbols which may be
alternative forms. Of the twenty-three to twenty-five letters in
T’ifinagh, some ten only have been derived from the classical
Libyan script as exemplified by the bilingual Thugga inscription
now in the British Museum. Of these ten letters perhaps five have
Punic parallels, while for the thirty known Libyan letters six
Phœnician parallels have been found. It has hitherto been
assumed<a id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class=
"fnanchor">[236]</a> that the T’ifinagh alphabet was descended from
the Libyan, which, it may be noted, has not yet been found in any
inscription proved to be earlier than the fourth century
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> Many theories have been advanced for
the origin of the Libyan script, but Halévy is usually accepted as
the most reliable authority on the subject. He supposed that the
Libyan alphabet was derived from the Phœnician with the addition of
certain non-Semitic symbols current nearly all over the
Mediterranean. If this were universally admitted as the correct
view it would still not be possible to explain why the T’ifinagh
alphabet contains so many symbols which are not common to either
the Libyan or Punic systems. On evidence which cannot here be
examined in detail, it seems easier to believe that the ancestors
of the Tuareg brought to Africa, or copied from a people with whom
they had been in contact before reaching the Sahara, an alphabet
replenished by borrowing certain symbols from a Libyan system
partly founded on the Phœnician one. A consideration of this
problem, like the one which concerns the Temajegh language itself,
must be left to experts to resolve. As much false analogy and loose
reasoning have been used on this question as on the subject of the
origin of the Libyan races. One thing only seems to me to stand
out, namely, that the T’ifinagh alphabet and Temajegh language were
not evolved in Africa but came from without, probably<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> from the east or north-east,
into the continent, where they developed independently. To
postulate an Arabian origin, for instance, for T’ifinagh and
Temajegh could not be construed as evidence in support of any
theory regarding the origin of the Tuareg themselves. Linguistic
evidence is notoriously unreliable from the anthropological point
of view, since more often than not it only indicates some cultural
contact. The most interesting aspect of the linguistic question is
the evidence which it may afford regarding the cultural development
of the older Tuareg. In their present stage of development there is
no reason for them to have retained, still less for them to have
evolved by themselves, any form of script. Their mode of life does
not necessitate the use of writing: they are for the most part
illiterate or are in process of becoming so. To have had and in so
far as they still use T’ifinagh, to have retained an individual
script, is to my mind the most powerful evidence in favour of the
conclusion to which I have already on several occasions referred,
namely, their far higher degree of civilisation in the past.</p>
<p>In Air, T’ifinagh is dying out. One tribal group is famous for
having retained it in current use more than any other section of
the Southern Tuareg. The Ifadeyen men and women still read and
write Temajegh correctly if somewhat laboriously. They use it for
sending messages to each other or for putting up notices on trees
or rocks, saying how one or other of them visited the place. Among
most of the other tribes a knowledge of T’ifinagh is confined to
the older women and a few men. The younger generation can neither
read nor write either in T’ifinagh or in Arabic: the scribes and
holy men usually only write in Arabic script. In the olden days all
the Tuareg women knew how to write and it was part of their duties
to teach the children.</p>
<p>The rocks of Air are covered with inscriptions which have
neither been recorded nor translated. Owing to the changing
linguistic forms of Temajegh and the absence of any very fixed
rules for writing it, it is difficult to decipher any
but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> the modern
writings. Words are not separated, vowels are not written, and
where one word ends with the same consonant with which the
following one begins, a single symbol is usually written for the
two.</p>

<p class="cp1">ROCK INSCRIPTIONS IN TIFINAGH</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>T’ifinagh script may be written from left to right or from right
to left, or up and down or down and up, or in a spiral or in the
boustrophedon manner. The European authors who have written of
Temajegh have variously reproduced T’ifinagh running from right to
left and from left to right, but the two best authorities, Hanoteau
and de Foucauld,<a id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">[237]</a> have adopted the former direction. It
ill becomes me to differ from such learned authorities, but the
existence of certain inscriptions in Air leads me to believe that
the left to right manner was, there at least, perhaps the most
usual system. On <a href="#i40">Plate 40</a> is reproduced an
<em>Arabic</em> inscription written by a Tuareg in Arabic
characters running in the wrong direction, namely, from left to
right, nor do I think the writer would have made this mistake
unless he had been accustomed so to write in the only other script
of which he could have had any knowledge, namely, T’ifinagh. The
inscription, of course, records the common “La illa ilallah
Muhammed rasul Allah.” I came across two or three other instances
of the same sort.</p>
<p>The T’ifinagh inscriptions in Air, like the pictures with which
they are so often associated, belong to all periods. Some of them
certainly date back to the first Tuareg invasion.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that the Quran was translated into Temajegh
and written out in T’ifinagh, a most improper proceeding from the
Moslem point of view. But no European has seen this interesting
book, which is said to have been destroyed. It may possibly have
survived in some place, for Ahodu told me he had once seen a book
in Air written in T’ifinagh, though all the documents which I found
in the mosques were in Arabic calligraphy. Until a “Corpus” of
T’ifinagh inscriptions has been compiled it will be very difficult
to make much progress.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Such a
collection would assist in the study of Temajegh itself, for the
language is in a somewhat fluid state, tending to vary
dialectically from place to place and period to period. It is one
of the languages termed “Berber,” the only connection in which I am
prepared to admit the use of this word. By many it is considered
the purest of the Berber forms of speech. Although related to such
dialects as Siwi and Ghadamsi, and to western forms like Shillugh
or the Atlas languages, Temajegh is distinct; it was not derived
from them but developed independently, and probably preserved more
of the original characteristics.</p>
<p>The relationship of the original tongue to the Semitic groups of
languages has not yet been defined. The two linguistic families
have certain direct analogies, including the formation of words
from triliteral verbal roots, verbal inflections, derived verbal
formations, the genders of the second and third persons, the
pronominal suffixes and the aoristic style of tense. Nevertheless
there are also certain very notable differences, like the absence
of any trace of more than two genders, the absence of the dual
form, and verbs of two or three or four radicals with primary forms
in the aorist and imperative only. Berber does not appear to be a
Semitic language. But the two are probably derived from a common
ancestor.</p>
<p>The Air and Ahaggar dialects of Temajegh differ somewhat from
each other. They are mutually quite intelligible, and so far as I
could judge not more diverse than English and American. Barth
stated that, unlike the rest of the Air Tuareg, the Kel Owi spoke
the Auraghiye dialect, which is the name often given to the Ahaggar
language. The name is, of course, derived from the Auriga or Hawara
ethnic group, which, as we shall see, is the name of the parent
stock of most of the Ahaggaren tribes. I have it on the best
authority, however, of Ahodu, ’Umbellu and Sidi, that the Kel Owi
language does not differ materially from the dialect of the rest of
Air and am therefore at a loss to be able to explain Barth’s
statement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>The absence of
the Arabic ع (<em>’ain</em>) in Temajegh necessitates its
transcription by the letter غ (<em>ghen</em>) which is so
characteristic of Berber. In all words, therefore, adopted from the
Arabic, and especially in proper names like ’Osman, ’Abdallah,
’Abdeddin, etc., the forms Ghosman, Ghibdillah, Ghabidin are used.
The Temajegh letter (<em>yegh</em>) ⵗ or <em>ghen</em> is common
and so strongly <em>grasseyé</em> that it becomes very similar to
an R. The difficulty of transcription of the T’ifinagh into
European languages is therefore very considerable,<a id=
"FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class=
"fnanchor">[238]</a> for the R and Gh sounds are very confusing. In
some T’ifinagh inscriptions the Arabic letter ع is frankly used
when Arabic words occur.</p>
<p>The great feature of the Temajegh language and of the Tuareg is
the diffusion of poetry. It is unfortunately impossible to give any
examples in this volume, but the collections made by Duveyrier,
Hanoteau, Masquerey, Haardt,<a id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and de Foucauld<a id=
"FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class=
"fnanchor">[240]</a> show the natural beauty and simplicity of this
art among the People of the Veil. Their prosody is not strict, but
nevertheless displays certain formality. Iambic verses of nine, ten
and eleven syllables are the most usual forms of scansion, with a
regular cæsura and rhymed or assonated terminations. In the matter
of rhymes there is considerable freedom: the use of similarly
sounding words is allowed. Terminations like “pen,” “mountain” and
“waiting” would, for instance, all be permissible as rhymes. Poetry
is sung, chanted or recited with or without music. The themes cover
the whole field of humanity, from songs of love or thanksgiving to
long ballads of war and travel. The Tuareg are in some measure all
poets, but the women are most famous among them. They make verses
impromptu or recite the traditional poems of their race which are
so old that their origin has been forgotten. One hears of women
famous throughout the Sahara as the greatest poets of their
time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>Their way of
life is attractive. These famous ladies hold what is called a
“diffa,” which is a reception or “salon.” In the evening in front
of their fires under an African night they play their one-stringed
“amzad” or mandoline and recite their verses. Men from all over the
country come to listen or take part. They seem to live and love and
think in much the same manner as in Europe those of us do who
retain our natural feelings. Only perhaps there are fewer
<em>grandes dames</em> in Europe now than in the Sahara.</p>
<p>Poetry, music and dancing are all to a great extent branches of
a single art in so far as they all depend on rhythm and seek to
express the emotions. In Air the syncopated music of the negro has
had more influence than in the north, so the “amzad” is less
common. Their other instruments are drums, but the lilt of their
dance is rather different from that of the south. Their improvised
drums are most ingenious. There is the hemispherical calabash
floating in a bowl of milk, the note of which varies according to
the depth to which the gourd is sunk, and the millet mortar with a
wet skin stretched over the mouth by two parallel poles weighed
down with large stones lying across their ends. The other various
drums of the Southland are also known and used by those who can
afford them. The dances of the Tuareg men are done to a quick step
on a syncopated beat. The most effective one is a sword dance by a
single man running up to the drum and executing a series of rapid
steps, with the sword held by both hands at arms’ length above the
head. I have never seen any women dancing among the Air Tuareg and
it is said not to be their practice. This may be so, for even among
the men dancing is relatively uncommon and has probably been
borrowed from the south. It seems hardly to be consistent with
their grave and dignified demeanour, of which poetry is the more
natural counterpart.</p>

<p class="sch">RELIGION AND BELIEFS</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nominally</span> at least all the Tuareg of Air
are now Moslems with the possible exception of some of the Imghad
of the Ikazkazan, who were described to me as Kufara (heathens).
Nevertheless, even to-day the Tuareg are not good Moslems, and
though, as a general rule, they say their prayers with regularity,
they are remiss in such matters as ablutions. These they never
perform except with sand or dust, which the Prophet enjoined were
only to be resorted to on journeys or where water was scarce.</p>
<p>As was explained at the beginning of this volume, the word
“Tuareg” is not used by the people themselves. It is used in the
first place by the Arabs, in a somewhat derogatory sense. Barth
makes no doubt about the etymology of the word Tuareg, or, as he
spells it, Tawarek. “. . . if the reader inquires who gave them the
other name (<em>i.e.</em> Tuareg), I answer in full confidence, the
Arabs; and the reason why they called them so was probably from
their having left or abandoned their religion, from the word
<span class="ar">ترك</span> (as in), ‘tereku dinihum’; for from
other evidence which I have collected elsewhere it seems clear that
a great part of the Berbers of the desert were once Christians . .
. and that they afterwards changed their religion. . . .”<a id=
"FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class=
"fnanchor">[241]</a> The name is written either with a ك or a ق,
but according to the learned traveller more often with the former
letter. The form “Terga” or “Targa” would, however, if the word is
identical radically with “Tuareg,” point to ق being correct in a
country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> where this
letter so often becomes a hard ج in the local Arabic. The singular
form of “Tuareg” is “Tarki” or “Tarqi,” with both forms of plural,
<span class="ar">توارك</span> and <span class="ar">تاركيون</span>.
Duveyrier<a id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class=
"fnanchor">[242]</a> and nearly all other authorities agree in
accepting this etymology, though some have suggested that it meant
“The People of the Sand.”<a id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Others add, as an
alternative explanation for the <span class="ar">ترك</span>
derivation, that it was not so much Christianity from which they
fell away but Islam after their conversion, and in support of this
their laxity in ritual is quoted. Duveyrier says that they were the
“Abandoned of God” on account of the delay in their conversion to
Islam and the numerous apostasies which occurred, or else because
of their evil and violent habits of life. There is no doubt of the
reproach attaching to the word, but the etymology is
unsatisfactory. In its original usage it seems to have referred
rather to a section of the Muleththemin than to the whole
race<a id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class=
"fnanchor">[244]</a>: if this observation is correct the religious
flavour attaching to the word is misleading, and it becomes simply
a proper name belonging to a section analogous to that of the
Sanhaja and Hawara.</p>
<p>The Tuareg of Air observe the usual religious feasts, but their
fasting during Ramadhan, which they call Salla Shawal, like their
ablutions, is usually excused on the grounds that they are
travelling. On the first day of Ramadhan it is customary to visit
the graves of ancestors and friends. The feast of Salla Laja or
Laya is held on the tenth day of the moon of Zu’lhajja;<a id=
"FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class=
"fnanchor">[245]</a> it is known in Turkey and Egypt as Bairam. On
this occasion sheep are slaughtered and the people feast for three
days. The feast of Bianu on the 20th of Muharrem is a sort of
Saturnalia, and very similar to certain festivities described as
occurring in Ashanti. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_275">[275]</span> feast lasts for a day and a half and is
marked by scenes of joy and happiness, for it commemorates God’s
forgiveness of humanity after the Flood. There is much dancing and
love-making and laughter, and the old people, the children and the
unmarried persons of the villages and camps are sent out of the
settlements while the revelries are in progress. The feasts of the
Birthday of the Prophet and of the Beginning of the Year are also
celebrated. It is customary when a journey is successfully
completed to give a sheep to be sacrificed for the poor, and when
there is much sickness among men or camels the same habit obtains.
When three of our camels had died in rapid succession at Auderas we
were urged to make sacrifice, and did so with three sheep.</p>

<p>I regret that I was never sufficiently fluent in Temajegh to
learn much of the superstitions of the Tuareg of Air. Such
information can only be obtained after prolonged residence among a
people, and superficial conclusions are worse than useless. There
is no doubt that underlying all their Islamic practices they hold
fundamental beliefs dating from their earlier religious practices,
regarding which only very few indications are available. The
existence of certain apparently Christian survivals led Duveyrier
and other authorities to assert that the Tuareg were Christians
before they were converted to Islam, and I am prepared to accept
this view in spite of the denials which have been expressed by so
eminent a writer as Bates. De Foucauld, I understand, was also
doubtful of their having been Christians, for among the earlier
beliefs which he found to be retained by the Tuareg of Ahaggar he
detected the remains of a polytheistic rather than a monotheistic
system. Bates has laboriously collected all the references to
religious beliefs among the Eastern Libyans, and any reader
interested in the subject cannot do better than refer to his work,
for even as far as Air is concerned I can add nothing
thereto.<a id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class=
"fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
<p>There are certain incontrovertible facts which demonstrate the
influence, at least, of Christianity among the People
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> the Veil. Much
has been written of their use of the cross in ornament, nor can its
so frequent occurrence be entirely fortuitous. I am aware that the
cross is a simple and effective form of decoration which any
primitive people is likely, unless formally prohibited, to have
used; but I find it hard to believe that the Tuareg, who, after
all, are not so very primitive in their culture, however much of it
they may have lost, had no other inducement than a lack of
imagination to drag in at every turn this symbol which their
religion expressly forbids them to use. Their cross-hilted sword,
which has been likened to a Crusader’s, may be a chance example of
the use of a design which is as convenient as it is simple, but the
tenacity with which they cling to the form, and only to this form,
is none the less curious. The cross in T’ifinagh script for the
letter “Iet” (T) is doubtless a pure accident occasioned by the
rectilinear character of the alphabet. But in that case the absence
of the equally convenient diagonal or St. Andrew’s cross is
strange. In other instances the appearance of the cross can be even
less lightly dismissed. The traditional form of ornamentation on
the Tuareg shield is purely and simply the Latin cross rising out
of what in design, apparently, is a traditional representation of
glory or light, depicted as a radiating mass. Bates argues that the
occurrence of a drawing of a shield with a cruciform design thereon
upon a rock in Tibesti is an argument against the view which I have
adopted, and that the use of this symbol is probably due to a
former practice of sun worship which he finds widespread in Libya.
But when it is realised how much the Tuareg of Air, to consider
only one group, raided in that direction, and how natural it would
be for them to commemorate a success by drawing their shield and
cross, which they regard as characteristic of themselves, on a
rock, his explanation seems rather lame. In the curved top of the
iron camel head-piece of Air I am inclined to see another survival
of the cross, such as also is probably the square top of their
spoons. The pommel of their camel saddle, a design which is always
strictly maintained, is another<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_277">[277]</span> convincing example, especially if the whole
equipment is compared with the Tebu sort. In construction the
Tuareg and Tebu saddles are very similar, though the cantle of the
latter is generally low. The pommel of the Tebu saddle takes the
form of a short upright member without any crosspiece or cruciform
tendency; it rarely rises much above the level of the rider’s legs.
It may be said, on the contrary, that the cross pommel of the
Tuareg saddle is the most prominent part of their whole gear. It is
of no practical value whatsoever, for the grip of the rider’s legs
never reaches as high as the projecting arms of the cross-top, and
it is extremely inconvenient for rapid mounting or dismounting in
their flowing robes. The cross is also extensively used in
ornamenting the leather-work of the saddle, and it plays a
considerable part in the traditional metal-work of the more
expensive quality.</p>

<p>In the course of my wanderings I saw two examples of sticks
which are planted in the ground when camp is pitched; they have a
crook on one side and are surmounted by a small cross of the same
shape as the one on the camel saddle. On these sticks are hung the
bridles and ropes when the camels are unsaddled. They are planted
outside a man’s tent, and sometimes indicate his high position or
prosperity.</p>
<p>At Agades I saw a house door ornamented with a border of tin
plate in which was cut the cross and ball design shown in <a href=
"#i36">Plate 36.</a> A similar example of the cross in design is in
the characteristic Agades cross which will be described later.</p>
<p>In addition to this evidence of the use of the cross, certain
words in Temajegh seem to be so closely associated with
Christianity as to require more explanation than the suggestion
that they were borrowed from the north in the course of contact
with the Romans or other Mediterranean influence. The commonest of
these words are given in the following list:<a id=

<p>In Air, God is referred to either as Mesi or as Ialla, which, of
course, comes from Allah. But there seems to be a slight difference
in the use of the two words, for when Ahodu and others talked of
praying they spoke of Ialla, but when he said to me that they were
aware there was only one God, who was mine as well as theirs, Mesi
was used.</p>
<p>The cumulative effect of all this evidence is to my thinking too
great for Bates’ view that the occurrence of the cross among the
Tuareg is merely due to the survival of certain practices connected
with the worship of the sun.</p>
<p>The Tuareg believe in Heaven and in Hell and in the Devil, but
the latter seems to be a somewhat vague personage in their cosmos.
Much more present are the good and evil spirits with which their
world, as that of all Moslems, is peopled. Belief in these spirits
among the Tuareg, however, is probably older than Islam, for they
also assert the existence of angels who are indistinguishable from
those of various Christian Faiths. Unfortunately the angels are
less active in Air than the many other sorts of spirits who haunt
the country. Among the latter are the Jinns or Elijinen,<a id=
"FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class=
"fnanchor">[249]</a> as they call them, which are ghosts living in
certain places or the spirits which attack people and send them
mad. Certain country-sides are known to be haunted by the sounds of
drumming, and curious things happen to people who visit<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> these parts after dark. The
spirits have to be fed, and bowls of porridge and water are left
out for them at night; they are invariably found empty next
morning. Occasionally the spirits make merry: then they can be
heard to play the drum and dance and sing. Elijinen speak Temajegh
and sometimes Arabic: people have spoken with them. The spirits are
rarely harmful, though they occasionally play practical jokes like
deceiving travellers or frightening sheep or goats. From time to
time, however, they do torture unfortunate people who displease
them.</p>
<p>The most powerful spirits in Air are identified with the
mountains just north of Iferuan, called Ihrsan, opposite which are
the mountains of Adesnu. In the olden time they fought against one
another, the one armed with a spear and the other with a sword. In
the equal combat Adesnu was transfixed and remains split to this
day, while the crest of Ihrsan was battered with the sword and
retains a serrated poll. They do not fight any more, but they often
talk to one another. Aggata in Central Air is also the home of a
spirit population, and so is Tebehic in the south.</p>
<p>Spirits are part of the every-day life of the universe. No one
doubts their existence. They may be found anywhere, even in the
open desert, where their drums are often heard. Evidence of such
noises is so circumstantial; although I have never experienced them
myself, I cannot fail to believe that they are heard. Some physical
explanation on the lines suggested by the late Lord Curzon in an
essay must certainly be accepted.<a id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
<p>The spirits which obsess men and women are more serious. I was
able to observe a case at Auderas, where Atagoom’s sister became
possessed—an affliction to which she had been liable for a long
time at irregular intervals. Her fits lasted from one to seven
days. She used to lie crouched and huddled all day, sometimes in
uncomfortable postures, but not apparently suffering from muscular
contraction or fits or spasms. At night she used to wander about
oblivious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> of her
surroundings, waking up the children or treading on the goats. Then
she would seize a sword and wave it about, thinking she was a man
and dancing like a man. It was said that if she could only get some
sleep, the spirit would go away, so I provided a sleeping draught
which her relations joyfully promised to administer. But they
failed in their endeavours because the spirit, of course, knew what
the medicine was and made the patient refuse to take it! The
treatment for these possessions is both kind and sensible.
Atagoom’s relations sat around her trying to attract her attention,
calling on her by name, and saying familiar things to her. All the
while they beat a drum to distract the spirit’s attention, and she
was constantly called or given things to hold or shown a child whom
she knew. As soon as the glassy stare leaves the patient’s eye, and
the attention can be caught, even for a moment, a cure is certain.
Persons afflicted in this way are usually women; it will happen to
them at the time they first become aware of men, which is not
necessarily when they first marry, but this rule also has many
exceptions. Atagoom’s small brother, aged about twelve years, was
shortly afterwards afflicted in the same way, but his access only
lasted one day.</p>
<p>The difficulty of exorcising spirits, at which the Holy Men of
Ghat, for instance, are said to be very proficient, is, as Ali
explained, that most of the people in Air who can read the Quran do
not understand it sufficiently well to do any good. Of course it
was useless, he added, to make charms unintelligently against the
“jenun.” In Air there was only one man who is really proficient. El
Mintaka, the scribe of Auderas, the man from Ghat, was said to know
the method, but it was not his speciality and he had not been very
successful.</p>
<p>The consensus of opinion is that, unlike many of the spirits at
Ghat, where they take the form of objects like pumpkins rolling
down the road in front of people who happen to be walking about at
night, those in Air do not assume visible shape. The spirit which
attacks women, nevertheless, is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_281">[281]</span> stated to have been seen by some people and
to have the aspect of a dragon; it is called “Tanghot.” Ghosts,
more especially the ones who live near tombs and deserted villages,
are called “Allelthrap.”</p>
<p>A famous legend in Air is that of the column of raiders which by
the mercy of Allah was swallowed up suddenly as a result of the
prayers of the Holy Man Bayazid. They were on the point of
capturing Agades when the ground opened before them, and in proof
thereof the Hole of Bayazid is shown to this day. The famous event
lives on in memory because at that place the water, which we have
already seen is naturally somewhat saline and foul in the immediate
vicinity of the city, is said to have been poisoned by the corpses
of the band. There is another story, too vague to record, of a
legendary hero or religious leader called Awa whose tomb in the
Talak area is an object of devotion. The rumour may repay
investigation, for the tomb was mentioned to me in connection with
the religious practices of the Air Tuareg before they became
Moslems.</p>
<p>Divination is resorted to by means of the Quran, and also by
playing that curious game resembling draughts which is so
widespread all over the world. In Air the game takes the form of a
“board” of thirty-six holes<a id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> marked in the sand. Each
player has thirteen counters made of date stones, or bits of wood,
or pebbles, or camel droppings. The object of the game is to
surround a pawn belonging to one’s adversary, somewhat on the
principle of “Noughts and Crosses.” The game is called “Alkarhat”
and when a Holy Man presides, the winner of three successive games
carries the alternative submitted for divine decision. Another form
of divination is resorted to by women who desire to obtain news of
their absent husbands or lovers; they sleep on certain well-known
tombs, and thus are favoured with a vision of their desire. The
women of Ghadames and of the Azger Tuareg do the same. The practice
appears to be identical with that described by Herodotus as current
among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
Nasamonians. It is also reported by Mela of the people of
Augila.<a id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class=
"fnanchor">[252]</a></p>
<p>The consequence of these beliefs in spirits is that amulets are
much in demand. They are especially in request to ward off the
direct influence of particular evils, which are, of course, more
especially potent when the local Holy Men have not been
sufficiently regaled with presents. There is no man in Air who does
not wear an amulet—usually a verse of the Quran in a leather
envelope—somewhere on his person. The more modest may confine
themselves to a little leather pouch tied in the white rag which is
worn around the head to keep the veil in place. On the other hand,
Atagoom, whose wealth permitted him the luxury, had little leather
pouches sewn on to every part of his clothing in addition to some
twenty-five strung on a cord round his neck. The manufacture of
these amulets is the principal source of revenue to the Holy Men of
Air. Besides verses written out on paper or skin other objects are
also used. Lion claws are very efficacious, and in some cases
fragments of bone of certain animals are good. I saw one bag
containing the head of a hawk, and another filled with pieces of
paper covered with magic squares. These leather amulet pouches are
the principal ornament worn by men, with the exception of the
“talhakim,” a most interesting object, the distribution of which in
Africa still remains to be ascertained.</p>
<p>The “talhakim” is an ornament shaped like a triangle surmounted
by a ring with three little bosses on its circumference. The
material used for making these objects is red agate or white
soap-stone or turquoise blue glass. They are so prized in the
Sahara and Sudan that cheaper varieties of red and white china or
glass were made in Austria before the Great War for trade purposes.
The stone “talhakim” are not made in Air. They come from the north.
I have it on the authority of Ali that they are not made at Ghat or
in the Fezzan either, I have, however, still to learn
where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> they actually
are made. The stone “talhakim” are beautifully cut and invariably
of the same design. The upper part of the triangle is sometimes
slightly thicker than the point, and in all cases is divided from
the ring part by a ridge and one or two parallel lines with the
addition, in some cases, of little indentations. I can neither find
nor suggest any explanation of the significance of the design. It
may be the prototype of the Agades cross, but I do not think it
likely. The bosses on the ring are essential to the design, and
somewhat similar, therefore, are agate rings which I used to see
worn in the same way as ornaments strung on leather cords around
the neck; they seemed too small to be worn on the finger. Most of
them had on one side three little bosses analogous to those on the
upper portion of the “talhakim.” These rings also came to Air from
the north.</p>
<p>The flat tablet or plate of stone or wood hung around the neck,
which is so widespread throughout the East, occurs in Air, but is
not common. The finest example I saw was worn by a man at Towar; it
was made of white soap-stone without any inscription on either
surface, but was very thin and finely cut.</p>
<p>The women but not men wear necklaces of beads, or beads and
small stone ornaments, resembling small “talhakim.” It has been
suggested that these little objects were similar to those which are
known, as far afield as Syria, to have been derived from stone
arrow-heads conventionalised as trinkets after they had ceased to
be used for weapons. In Air, however, I am convinced the necklace
ornaments are intended as small “talhakim,” and I am loth to
believe that the latter are conventionalised arrow-heads both on
account of the difficulty presented by their large size and also on
account of the essential upper ring portion, which points to a
different origin. Circular bangles and bracelets with an opening
between two knobs such as are worn in the north are affected by the
Tuareg women; they are made of brass and copper and in some cases
of silver. The workmanship of the latter, considering that they are
made by the local blacksmith with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_284">[284]</span> his ordinary tools, is remarkably good. On
these bracelets the knobs are surprisingly accurate cubes with the
eight corners hammered flat, forming a figure having six square and
eight triangular facets.</p>
<p>Of all the Air ornaments the so-called Agades cross is the most
interesting. The lower part is shaped like the cross on the pommel
of the camel saddle; its three points terminate in balls or cones.
The fourth or upper arm of the cross fits on to a very large ring
similar to that on the “talhakim,” and curiously enough also
provided with three excrescences, though in this case all near one
another at the top of the circle. An elaborate form worn by Ahodu’s
wife had a pierced centre, but this was not generally a part of the
design. A conventionalised form was seen among the Fulani and
Kanuri of Damergu, where in one case the shape had been so lost
that it had become a simple lozenge suspended from a small ring. In
all the examples which I saw in Air the large ring of the ornament
was obviously, as in the “talhakim,” an essential part of the
whole; all the rings also had the three protuberances on the
circumference. The cross is worn by men and women alike; it is
referred to as the Ornament of the Nobles. They regard it as
characteristic of themselves. The stone “talhakim” is worn in the
Sudan, but the Agades cross is only known in Damergu, where it has
been borrowed as a result of contact with the Tuareg, and in a
debased form. In Air it seems as characteristic of the race as the
face veil, and like the latter it is never put off, as are the
amulet pouches and garments when heavy work necessitates
stripping.</p>

<p>The origin of both “talhakim” and cross must remain matters of
conjecture. The former may or may not be, but the latter certainly
is, peculiar to the People of the Veil; its occurrence is yet
another example of the deep-rooted habit of mind which inculcates
the use of the cross among the race. The ideal explanation, in view
of the common characteristics of the ring and three excrescences
thereon, would be that the “talhakim” and cross had an identical
origin. But the cross suggests association with
Christianity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> while
the large ring points rather to some derivation from the Egyptian
Ankh: the latter in my own opinion is more probable.</p>
<p>Two other adornments there are in Air, both restricted to men: a
flat plaque and stone arm rings. The former is a flat rectangular
piece of tin or silver, usually 2½ to 3 inches long by 1 inch
broad, with some slight embossed design on the surface. It is often
worn on the head, tied by two little thongs or threads to the band
of stuff which is used to secure the veil around the forehead. The
ornament may simply be a metal form of amulet pouch, but it
certainly bears a striking resemblance to a fibula, which in the
course of time for the sake of easier manufacture is turned out
without a pin. The plaque is also worn on the shoulder, like
certain classical brooches were on the Roman togæ, from which the
white robes of North Africa are said to be descended.<a id=
"FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class=
"fnanchor">[253]</a></p>
<p>No man among the Tuareg will be seen who does not wear one or
more arm rings, usually above the elbow and upon either or both
arms. The rings are of two main types, a cylindrical ring some ¾ to
1 inch deep by ⅛ to ¼ inch thick, and of the circumference of a
man’s forearm, with two or three ridges on the outer surface, and a
flat ring some ¼ inch thick, of the same inner circumference, and ¾
to 1 inch broad. The second type is the most important and appears
to be the traditional sort. Deep significance is to be attached to
the custom of wearing these rings, and there are differences
attributed to the numbers and position of the rings on the arms.
But whilst I was well aware of the importance of these usages, I
was unable to ascertain their precise interpretation. Only it is
clear that boys do not wear the rings, that a ring is worn when the
sword is girt on, that in the first place only one ring is worn,
and that once a ring has been put on it is not again put off. The
rings of all types should be made of stone. In Air a soft
argillaceous stone of a greenish-grey hue found in the eastern
hills is used. The rings are cut by hand without a lathe from a
lump of stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> about
one inch thick. The rough ring is smoothed and fined down with
rasps and files and finally cleaned with sand and water. The
traditional flat rings tend to taper from the inner to the outer
circumference. When the cutting and shaping of the rings have been
finished, they are dipped in fat and then baked, to give the
slightly porous stone a deep black colour and a polished surface.
The flat rings seem to be very important, for they are passed on
from father to son. They are often mended with riveted brass plates
if they happen to have been broken, and sometimes bear
inscriptions, for the most part only names, in T’ifinagh. Of late,
rings appear to have been made of a hard baked clay which is also
dipped in fat, but they break too readily.</p>
<p>Elaborate and fanciful explanations have been suggested for the
practice, which has a sacred or at least mystic association. One
author, who shall be nameless, has suggested that the rings were
worn—and presumably he saw a Tuareg with many rings on both arms—to
enable a man to crush his enemy’s skull when they closed in battle.
I myself cannot offer any explanation worthy of much consideration.
I must, however, note that such rings, especially when worn, as
some always are, above the elbow, and also at the wrist, afford a
valuable protection to the vulnerable arm muscles against
sword-cuts. Nevertheless, if such was the reason for their first
use they have become traditional with the lapse of time.</p>
<p>The last of these matters to which I propose to allude is the
use of the Veil, a practice which has certainly assumed a ritual
form. No self-respecting Tuareg of noble or servile caste will
allow himself to be seen even by his most intimate friends without
a veil over his face. The habit has no analogy in the practice of
the Arabian Arabs, who sometimes cover their faces with the ends of
their head-cloths to protect the mouth and face against the sun and
sand. This is a hygienic device<a id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>; the Tuareg veil is more
mysterious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> Not the
least of the difficulties connected with the veil is, that it is
not mentioned by classical authors in referring to people in North
Africa who seem to be the ancestors of the present Tuareg and
otherwise to correspond to descriptions of the latter. It is only
with the advent of the Arabic writers that these same people are
first referred to by the name of Muleththemin, the Veiled
People.</p>
<p>The veil or “Tagilmus” is a long strip of indigo cloth woven and
dyed in the Sudan. The best quality is made of six narrow strips
about one inch wide sewn together, edge to edge. The material and
the open stitching leave plenty of room for the air to pass
through, and even a considerable degree of transparency. The veil
is put on in the following wise: about one-half of the length is
folded over three times into a band only 2½ inches wide. The part
where the full breadth begins is placed over the forehead low
enough to cover the nose; the narrow band is to the right, the
broad part to the left. The latter is then passed round the back of
the head and looped up under the narrow part, which is wound around
the head on top of the broad portion so as to hold the latter in
place. The broad part over the nose is pulled up into a pleat along
the forehead and forms the hood over the eyes, being called
“temeder.” There remains a long loop of the dependent broad portion
held by the narrow fastening band: it hangs loosely from over the
right ear, behind which it is passed, over to the left ear, behind
which the end is brought and passed, under the narrow fastening
band running round the head. The lower part of the veil thus falls
below the wearer’s chin in a loop, both ends being under the narrow
band which holds them in place. The centre of the strip is taken
and placed on the bridge of the nose, and all the slack is pulled
in from the two points over the ears. The lower part of the veil,
called “imawal,” should now hang from the bridge of the nose over
the mouth and chin without touching them; the upper edge from the
nose to the lobes of the ears ought to be nearly horizontal. Thus
worn, the veil leaves a slit about ½ to 1 inch wide<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span> in front of the eyes, which,
with a small part of the nose, are all that one can ever see of a
Tuareg’s face.</p>
<p>In this veil the men live and sleep. They lift the “imawal” up
to eat but in doing so hold their hand before the mouth. When the
veil requires re-fixing, a man will disappear behind a bush to
conceal his features even from his own family. These rigorous
prescriptions are to some extent less strictly observed in the
south among the younger generation, but they belong to the pride of
race of the Tuareg. Even when the French induced some Tuareg to
visit Paris, they declined to allow their photographs to be taken
unveiled. They declared that they had no Moslem prejudices on the
subject but firmly refused to entertain the idea.</p>
<p>What is the explanation of this curious habit? Every unlikely
theory has been advanced, from that of the desire of raiders to
conceal their faces in order to escape recognition, to the one
which suggests that the Tuareg were the Amazons of the classics,
and that the habits adopted by men and women respectively in such a
society had become confused. Of this order of hypotheses the
simplest one is that which explains the veil as a purely hygienic
accessory designed to protect the wearer against the blinding glare
and the sand of the desert: from the first use of the veil for this
purpose the habit gradually became so innate as to acquire a ritual
significance.</p>
<p>But none of these theories are really tenable: the Tuareg
recognise each other, and foreigners can do the same in a short
time, as easily in the veil as a man of another race without the
veil. The Tuareg are not the Amazons of the classics, at least in
the form in which popular beliefs have conceived the latter; nor is
there, as a matter of fact, any reason to suppose that the Amazons,
either male or female, veiled themselves. There is no logic in only
the men veiling their faces and the women going unveiled if the
veil were really intended for hygienic purposes; still less is any
explanation of this nature reasonable for the use of the veil at
night or in the rainy season. Yet almost all Tuareg,
unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> they have
become denationalised, would as soon walk unveiled as an English
man would walk down Bond Street with his trousers falling down. No
other race in the world possesses this peculiar habit, though some
among the population of the Fezzan and the Sudan in contact with
them have adopted it. The habit is essentially characteristic of
the Tuareg. It is as typical of them as the cross-hilted sword, the
cross-pommelled saddle, the status of their women, and their
T’ifinagh script.</p>
<p>On attaining the age of puberty, Tuareg youths in Air put on the
large trousers which all Moslems should wear, and soon afterwards
they begin to carry a sword and wear an arm ring. The first event
may take place when they reach sixteen or seventeen; the others,
two or three years later. As soon as they have put on the dress of
a man they are inscribed in the register of the Holy Man of their
village or tribe and they commence their individual existence. The
veil, however, is sometimes not donned until the mature age of
twenty-five years; in no case is it worn until several years have
elapsed after the sword is girt on. The ceremony of putting on the
veil for the first time is accompanied by much rejoicing in the
family and feasting and dancing.</p>
<p>Two aspects of this habit strike one. In the first place the
ceremonial significance to which I have already alluded is very
apparent, and in the second place the comparatively late age at
which the veil first begins to be worn is curious in an Eastern
people, where physical development takes place early in life. A
parallel may perhaps be noticed in the late date at which marriages
take place in Air. I questioned Ahodu closely about these practices
connected with the veil, but obtained no satisfactory information:
he had nothing to say on the subject except that a man was not a
proper man until he had put on the veil. And there, for the moment,
one must leave the matter.</p>
<p>The veil will be found wherever the Tuareg live, and only when
the riddle of their origin is solved will an explanation probably
be forthcoming. Equally obscure is the absence of any reference to
the veil among them until the time of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_290">[290]</span> Arab authors. But up to the present no
reasonable theory has been advanced.</p>
<p>Mention has been made on several occasions of the Holy Men of
Air. As is natural among superstitious people, they have always
been a powerful part of the community. In mitigation, it must be
said that they have probably had a hard fight to keep the Tuareg in
the way of Islam at all. Where Europeans have been concerned their
influence has been uncompromisingly hostile. It was certainly the
Inisilman, as they are called in Temajegh, of T’intaghoda who tried
to have Barth and his companions killed on more than one occasion.
The attack on the Foureau-Lamy Mission at Iferuan was also due to
them. Their counsel to fall on the French expedition a second time
would have prevailed at Agades had it not been for the advice of
Ahodu and the common-sense of the Sultan, who replied to their
promptings that if the attack failed he would have to face the
consequences alone, while they, in the name of God and the Faith,
saved their own skins.</p>
<p>With an effete monarch and lazy Añastafidet at Agades, the most
important men in Air to-day are Inisilman like Haj Musa of Agellal,
Haj Saleh of the Kel Aggata at Agades, Agajida of the Kel Takrizat,
’Umbellu of T’imia, and Abd el Rahman of the Ikazkazan. Their
influence is not exerted through sectarian organisations nor has
any “tariqa” like that of the Senussi taken root in Air. The Tuareg
have repeatedly come under the influence of the Senussiya,
especially during the late war, but in Air at least they never
became affiliated to the sect. They have continued to regard its
tenets as heretical and its policy as selfish.</p>
<p>A certain number of the Air tribes such as the Igdalen, Kel
Takrizat, Isherifan, etc., are reputed to be holy. The Igdalen are
said not to carry or resort to arms, but use only pens and prayer.
It is difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the distinction
which they possess over other noble tribes, but the same
differentiation is known among other sections of the People of the
Veil. They cannot and do not claim<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_291">[291]</span> descent from the Prophet, nor are their
lives any holier or in the main different from those of their
fellows. The Kel T’intaghoda who are Inisilman are reputed even in
Air to be great scoundrels. The Kel Takrizat are not less warlike
than other tribes. Their <em>raison d’être</em> must be sought in
the shadowy past to which all problems surrounding the early
religion of the Tuareg are still relegated. On this subject too
little information is at present available.</p>
<p>The people of Air belong to the Maliki persuasion of Islam, as a
result of the teaching of a great leader who came amongst them in
the early sixteenth century. His name was Muhammad ben Abd el Kerim
el Maghili, surnamed El Baghdadi, and he was the Apostle of Islam
in the Central Sudan. El Maghili belonged to Tilemsan and was born
either at that place or in Tuat, where he was brought up. He was a
contemporary of El Soyuti (<span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1445-1505), the Egyptian, whose encyclopædic works were destined to
perpetuate Moslem learning of the fifteenth century. El Maghili was
a man of bold and enterprising character. By his uncompromising
fanaticism he stirred up massacres of the Jews in Tuat, which he
eventually left in order to convert the Sudan. He preached in
Katsina and in Kano, as well as in Air.<a id=
"FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class=
"fnanchor">[255]</a> “Living in the time when the great Songhai
empire began to decline from that pitch of power which it had
reached under the energetic sway of Sunni Ali and Muhammad el Haj
Askia, and stung by the injustice of Askia Ismail, who refused to
punish the murderers of his son, he (El Maghili) turned his eyes on
the country where successful resistance had first been made against
the all-absorbing power of the Asaki, and turned his steps towards
Katsina.” On his way thither he passed through Air, where he
preached and gave to those Tuareg who were already Moslems a way of
salvation, and to the others the first beginnings of their present
Faith. He founded a mosque at Abattul near Auderas, and one of his
sons is said to have been buried there; the tomb at least is
described as his. A short distance<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_292">[292]</span> away on the road north from Auderas he
knelt to pray in the Erarar n’Dendemu at the point known as
Taghist, and the place was marked by a roughly rectangular
enclosure of stones with a semi-circular bay in the eastern side
near a small tree marking the Qibla. Travellers always stay there
to make their prayers by the road. The place is remembered and
far-famed as the “Makam el Sheikh ben Abd el Kerim,” but others
call it the “Msid Sidi el Baghdadi,” the name by which he is
usually known in Air, where men who have lived long in the East
often earn this surname. His stay in Air was not entirely
peaceable, for he was eventually driven out by these lax Moslems on
account of his uncompromising attitude. It is reported
traditionally that he was attacked by a party of Aulimmiden in
Western Air, but was not apparently killed, for thereafter he again
preached in Katsina. He eventually heard that one of his sons had
been murdered in Tuat, probably by the Jews, for motives of
revenge, and he set out for the north once more, but died before
reaching the end of his journey. It is probably to this period that
the attack in the west on his person must be referred. His death
occurred between <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1530 and 1540. El
Maghili left behind him the greatest name of any religious teacher
in Air and in the Central Sudan. Twenty volumes of his works on law
and theology, in addition to a correspondence in verse and prose
with El Soyuti,<a id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a> have survived in various places.</p>
<p>Near the “Makam el Sheikh ben Abd el Kerim,” which is only one
of many similar prayer enclosures in Air, are some mounds of loose
stones. On every important road such enclosures and mounds may be
seen. The simplest form of praying-place is a semi-circular line of
stones; the larger places have a rectangular plan like the mosques.
Whenever a standing camp is set up, a place of prayer is cleared
and marked, and once made these hallowed areas are not disturbed.
The mounds of stones by the roadside mark spots where some holy man
has stopped to pray or where some equally important but long since
forgotten incident has<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_293">[293]</span> befallen. But although oblivion may have
overtaken the event, passing caravans continue to commemorate the
place; each man picks up a stone and throws it on the heap. The
habit is good, for it clears the paths of loose stones. I acquired
much respect by observing the custom scrupulously myself. I made my
men do the same, and so assisted in perpetuating a highly
commendable and utilitarian practice. Thanks to the many prayers
which El Baghdadi must have said all over the neighbourhood, the
paths over the Erarar n’Dendemu have been cleared of loose stones.
The heaping of stones serves the additional purpose of marking
tracks in a difficult country. Where rocks abound or the exact way
through a defile is hard to find, it has also become the habit to
indicate the way by placing different coloured stones in little
heaps on the guiding rocks. It is a superstition that if the
traveller does not either add to a mound or help to mark a path,
some evil will befall him by the way.</p>
<p>In spite of the proselytising of El Baghdadi and the Holy Men of
Air, much of the older Faith remained. They were unable to
eradicate the use of the cross. The people are also given at times
to using camel bells despite the injunctions of the Prophet, who
denounced it as an object associated with Christianity. It is also
possible to see in the status of women the practice of monogamy,
the ownership of property by women, and the treatment of the wife
as her husband’s equal, survivals of a state of society which must
in many respects have been regarded by El Baghdadi as heretical and
tending towards Christian ideals.</p>
<p>Is there after all any difficulty in accepting the view that the
Tuareg were Christians before Islam in the Near East became
victorious over all that schismatic and heterogeneous Christianity
of the Dark Ages which did so little credit to the religion which
we profess? There was a time when the Bishoprics of North Africa
were numbered by the score. What was more natural than that
Christianity should have spread into the interior? When the Arabs
first came into Africa, we are told by Ibn Khaldun and El Bekri
that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> found in
Tunisia and Algeria a majority of the population apparently
Christian. Certain “Berber” tribes, however, were Jews, while the
Muleththemin, in part, were heathens. The profession of Judaism by
people including the inhabitants of the Aures hills, who had Kahena
the Queen as their leader in the eighth century <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span>, means no more than that they professed some form
of monotheism which is not inconsistent with Aryan Christianity.
But in any case Christianity was quite sufficiently widespread to
have accounted for the survival of certain beliefs among the People
of the Veil. Even so remote a part of Africa as Bornu was known to
have been subjected to the influence of Coptic Christianity from
the Nile Valley, and we have Bello’s testimony that the Gober
chiefs were Copts.<a id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257"
class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Why, then, should not the Tuareg have
been Christians too?</p>
<p>Neither to Islam nor to Christianity, however, can be attributed
what is susceptible only of explanation as a survival of totemism.
The Northern Tuareg<a id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258"
class="fnanchor">[258]</a> believe that “they must abstain from
eating birds, fish and lizards, on the score that these animals are
their mothers’ brothers. This reason at once suggests that these
taboos are both totemic and matriarchal in their origin”; but while
the facts have been alluded to by many authors, the possibility
that the taboos may be of recent and therefore of Sudanese, origin
has not been sufficiently taken into account.<a id=
"FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class=
"fnanchor">[259]</a> As against their southern origin—for birds and
fishes are recognised as totemic animals, in Nigeria, for
instance—it may be pointed out that no proscription against these
animals obtains in Air. Instead, however, another taboo is strongly
indicated in the belief which the Tuareg of the latter country
hold, that the harmless and vegetarian jerboa is second only in
uncleanliness to the pig. Any food or grain which the jerboa has
touched must be destroyed, but rats and mice are not abhorred, and
the large rat or bandicoot of the Southland is even
eaten.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> Bates cites
examples of the ceremonial eating of dogs among the Eastern
Libyans, and considers that this may also have been a taboo animal,
but these rites are not found in Air, where the eating of dogs,
pigs, horses, donkeys or mules in any circumstance is regarded as
infamous. Incidentally the prohibition regarding pigs is probably
very old, for Herodotus states that none of the Libyans in North
Africa bred swine in his day, and the women of Barca abstained from
eating pork, as well as in certain cases cow’s flesh, on
ritualistic grounds.<a id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href=

<p>I have a distinct impression of an animistic view of nature
among the Tuareg in Air, but I am unable to base it on any tangible
evidence. Herodotus tells us that the Libyans sacrificed to the sun
and moon,<a id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class=
"fnanchor">[261]</a> and Ibn Khaldun<a id=
"FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class=
"fnanchor">[262]</a> certainly states that the early Berbers
generally worshipped the sun. Bates deduces that the Eastern
Libyans revered the sun, and connects their rites with bull worship
and the Egyptian deity Amon. The only surviving Libyan name for the
solar deity is preserved by Corippus as Gurzil.<a id=
"FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class=
"fnanchor">[263]</a> A trace of sun worship survives in Air perhaps
in association with the Kel Owi tribes. When the sun is veiled by
white cloud in the early morning and the temperature is low, it is
customary to say that “it is as cold as the mother of the Kel Owi,”
or “the mother of the Kel Owi is cold.” I asked for an explanation
of the remark, and was told that the sun was the mother of the Kel
Owi, and that when the early morning air was cold the saying was
used, for the Kel Owi are known to be ungenerous and mean.</p>
<p>The weather superstitions of the Tuareg are numerous. The
climate on certain mornings of the year is heavy and still, with a
thick cirro-cumulus cloud in the sky; when this occurs it is held
to presage some evil event. A north-west wind, with the thick haze
which so often accompanies it, indicates the advent of raiders from
the north, probably because in the past some famous raids have

weather. Similarly a haze without wind, or a light north-east
breeze and a damp mist, are warnings of Tebu raids. The fall of a
thunderbolt is a very evil omen, as also is the rare form of
atmospheric phenomenon to which the general name of “Tufakoret” is
given. It consists of a slight prismatic halo around the sun in the
clear morning sky when there is no evident sign of rain. The
phenomenon is probably due to the refraction of low sunlight in
semicondensed water vapour derived from heavy dew. A sunset behind
a deep bank of cloud causing a vivid or lurid effect but obscuring
the disc of the sun is also called “Tufakoret” and is equally a bad
sign. A morning rainbow “Tufakoret” was seen in Air shortly before
the late European war broke out. An ordinary rainbow in wet weather
is a good omen.</p>
<p>The two most noticeable virtues among the Tuareg, that of
patience and of a sense of honour, have not come to them from
Islam. They are attributable to something older. Their patience is
not that of quietism or of fatalism. It is rather the faculty of
being content to seek in the morrow what has been denied in the
present. They take the long view of life and are not querulous;
they are of the optimistic school of thought. Theirs has seemed to
me the patience of the philosopher and not the sulky resignation of
a believer in pre-ordained things.</p>
<p>Their ethical standards of right and wrong, while differing
profoundly from our own, and in no way to be commended or condemned
in our shallow European way, seem to come from some older
philosophy, some source less obvious than their present religion.
Not only have they standards which the Quran does not establish or
even approve, but they hold certain codes of conduct for which
there can be no legislation. When right and wrong, or good and
evil, are not obviously in question, and a Tuareg will still say
that a man does not do a thing because it is dishonourable and an
action such as no Imajegh would commit, it must mean that his
forefathers did learn in an ancient school to seek some goal which
is no reward in the present material life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Such development
is only found in societies, whether Christian, Moslem or otherwise,
which have for long been evolving under the guidance of a few men
who have learnt much and taught much. Yet the feet of the Tuareg
are not now kept in this way; their conduct is unconscious. They
are no community of philosophers seeking by choice to live in
primitive conditions for the betterment of their souls. They hold
what they have as an inheritance of grace from bygone generations.
In mind, as in custom, they are very old. Only a slight glow of the
past glory remains to gild the meanness of their perpetual struggle
and the eternal hardship of existence. It is doubtful whether they
could still be caught and moulded afresh. There is too little left
of the now threadbare stuff; it just survives in the clean air of
the desert; it would fall to pieces in the atmosphere of more
luxurious circumstance. And then, nothing would remain but lying
tongues and thieving hands unredeemed by any saving grace.</p>

<p class="sch">NORTHERN AIR AND THE KEL OWI</p>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> I returned to Auderas from Tabello
I found the valley had dried up very much. The hamlets were already
in great part deserted. The people had moved out of the settlements
with their flocks in search of better pasture than could be found
on the parched trees and straw of the little valleys. Ahodu,
temporarily relieved of his authority pending an adjudication in
Agades on a dispute regarding the possession of certain date palms,
was living about two miles down the valley with a part of our
camels and his own goats and sheep. I was now anxious to stay as
short a time as possible in this part of the country, since I
wanted to see the north during the time which remained before I was
due to return to England. Ahodu himself was unable to come with me,
but he provided as guide an Imajegh called Sidi from his own Kel
Tadek people at Auderas. With a few camels, my servant and two
other men I set forth once more on November 3rd by the now familiar
road to the Assada valley. Camping there on the second day out, I
met a large caravan of Kel T’imia bound for Damergu via Agades.
They were ostensibly trading in dates but were in reality destined
for the Southland to undertake transport work in Nigeria during the
winter months.</p>
<p>The weather was very pleasant, but in the open country the
temporary watering-places were fast disappearing. The maximum day
temperatures varied between 90° and 95° F. in the shade; the nights
were already fresh with temperatures as low as 42° F.</p>
<p>On the following day after leaving the Assada camp I did a
thirty-mile march along the valley, past the site of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> Aureran well with a few ruined
stone houses both there and on the way there, and then up a side
valley under Mount Arwa Mellen. At the mouth of the Tegidda valley
my track branched off from the road which I had followed earlier in
the year with Buchanan to T’imia. I proceeded north into the Anu
Maqaran basin over the low pass to which both Barth and Foureau
refer. From the col a long sweep of grassy plain ran gently down to
the great valley of Central Air. It is here called T’imilen after
the mountains which lie on the north bank of the section higher up,
where it is named Abarakan. The T’imilen mountains are a
continuation of the small Agalak massif which was just visible to
the north; its south-west face lying on my right was very imposing
with steep and rugged sides. Straight in front of the pass, beyond
the valley, a gap appeared between the broken mass of the Agalak
and a small, bold mountain called Aggata on the left hand. The gap,
wherein were framed the distant mountains of Northern Air, proved
to be a basin containing the Agalak and Aggata tributaries of the
main T’imilen valley. I camped within an hour of the pass, a few
hundred yards from the north bank of the main bed at the deep well
of Aggata, not far from the mountain which is also called by that
name.</p>
<p>When the Bila and Bagezan massifs appear on the southern
horizon, one may be said to have entered Northern Air. While the
north-eastern part is more properly the country of the Kel Owi
tribes, the whole area north of the central massifs, including the
western plain and the towns of Agellal, Sidawet and Zilalet, was
largely under their influence. This part of Air is a rugged plateau
crossed by wide valleys and broken by only relatively small
mountain groups. The most distinctive feature is the number of
little peaks which rise abruptly into sharp points and ridges. But
though small they are no mere conical hillocks, for they are
crowned with the pinnacles and towers usually associated with the
Dolomites. T’iriken, for instance, on the way to Assode, has a
triple crest rising out of a crown,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_300">[300]</span> like the fangs of a tooth. T’imuru is a
saddle-backed ridge with turrets along the crest like the spikes on
a scaly reptilian back. Asnagho, near Agellal, is shaped like an
axe; the one profile is sharp as a blade set on edge, the other
flat and long. Most beautiful of all are Arwa and Aggata, soaring
out of the plain like dream castles, with battlements and keeps and
curtain walls perched high above the cliffs and screes of the lower
glacis. The landscape is rather less coloured than in the centre or
south, for until the edge of the northern mountains of Air is
reached there are hardly any big trees or green vegetation in the
valleys. But the same red and black of the rocks against a blue sky
and straw-coloured ground prevail.</p>
<p>Aggata well proved copious but somewhat stagnant. Agalak well is
also deep and similar. It is the country of deep wells, and they
are ascribed to the first Tuareg, the Itesan. They are anything up
to 100 feet or more deep and 10 to 12 feet broad. The sides are
carefully dry-walled with rough basalt boulders. The well mouths
are slightly raised above the level of the ground and surrounded by
great logs of wood, scored with rope-marks. They are undoubtedly
the work of highly-skilled diggers and may be pre-Tuareg. Many of
them require cleaning out, but none of them seems to have fallen
in.</p>

THE AUTHOR</p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>I slept quite quietly at Aggata and was disappointed at not
hearing the Drums of the Spirits which haunt the mountain. The next
day I again marched some thirty miles, around Aggata and T’imuru
peaks, where there is an old deep well, now, alas! silted up, and
reached Assode, once the most considerable town in Air after
Agades. The plain was flat and the going good, even over the
scattered rock outcrop. Mirages were showing all the time. The
mount of T’in Awak, north of the point I was making for, shone in
the dancing air like a chalk hill standing in a blue lake. There
was no shade and it was hot. We were all tired and disappointed by
the elusive valley which continually crept away beyond another
ridge, so when Assode was finally<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_301">[301]</span> reached we were very glad. The Agoras, or
“The Valley” by which the town lies, is not inspiring; and the site
is marked by no prominent feature. The position, however, is
otherwise interesting. The Agoras rises in the Agalak-T’imia massif
and joins the basin of Northern Air not far north of Assode; the
low hills on the north bank of the Agoras surround the town like
the rim of a saucer. The position is not artificially fortified,
but could readily have been defended, were it not that the only
well lies some hundreds of yards distant from the houses in the bed
of the valley.</p>
<p>Assode is said by Jean<a id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> to have been built by
the Kel Owi for the first Añastafidet, but is certainly older than
that. It very possibly dates from the first immigration of Tuareg.
The reputed date of its foundation in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
900 is therefore far more probable than that which Jean’s statement
implies. Nor is there any reason to follow Barth<a id=
"FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class=
"fnanchor">[265]</a> in setting it down to be of recent origin
simply because it is not mentioned by Arabic authors. The
superficial extension of the place is considerable, but the
settlement belongs to various periods, and not all the 1000 ruined
houses were probably ever inhabited at the same time. Although it
is completely abandoned to-day, the population, even in Barth’s
time, had become scanty, for he heard that only eighty houses were
occupied, despite the fact that it was then, as in former and also
more recent times, the official place of residence of the
Añastafidet.<a id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class=
"fnanchor">[266]</a></p>
<p>On a small rise in the middle of the little basin is the mosque,
the largest building in Air.<a id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The minaret fell many
years ago, but the mosque is still well preserved in spite of the
rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> which, since
the evacuation of 1918, has gradually been breaking down the roof.
The saucer in which the town lies warrants the construction of a
minaret to serve, like the one at Agades, as a watch-tower. The
general plan of the building may be gathered from <a href=
"#i32">Plate 32.</a> The roof is low, as in all the Air mosques.
The various outhouses and separate portions were used as khans and
as schools. It once boasted a large library, the rotting remains of
which I collected. I made up a whole camel load of these
manuscripts<a id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class=
"fnanchor">[268]</a> and took them to Iferuan, where I placed them
in charge of the local alim, who turned out to be El Mintaka from
Auderas. The books in part proved to be the remains of the private
library of El Haj Suliman of Agellal, who possessed over 1000
volumes; he lived in the last century and belonged to the Qadria
sect.</p>
<p>North of the mosque was the quarter where the Añastafidet used
to live. The houses seemed to be mainly of the “A type.” The
dwellings further south were more numerous, and included examples
of all types and periods. The houses for the most part were
surrounded by low compound walls and lay close together along
narrow streets and lanes. No particular details are worth recording
except the presence in many of the houses of grain pits, some of
which had been used for concealing belongings and might repay
investigation.<a id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269"
class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>
<p>The most interesting feature of Assode, considering its size,
was the absence of all traces of garden or date cultivation. The
town was obviously inhabited only by camel-owners and their
domestic slaves. It was a trading depot and a metropolis, but not a
productive centre, for even the pasture in the neighbourhood is
limited. The selection of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_303">[303]</span> the place as the residence of the
Añastafidet must have been due to its convenience as a centre for
the tribes of the Confederation of Kel Owi. It also suited the
conditions of their trade, and therefore probably that of their
predecessors in the area, the first Tuareg to enter Air. As a
strategic position it was admirably located, well within the
borders of the plateau, and consequently not liable to be easily
raided from without; tactically, also, it was defensible. It is
interesting to note that of the thirty to forty wars, most of which
were in Air and Tegama, mentioned in the Agades Chronicle, only two
are recorded at Assode, whereas Agades was repeatedly involved.
Assode was, to my mind, unquestionably the first real capital of
the country, before Agades or any town in Tegama assumed an
important rôle.</p>
<p>The great Kel Owi tribes in modern times are the Kel Azañieres,
the Kel Tafidet and the Ikazkazan. The major part of the
confederation lived in North and North-eastern Air; the Ikazkazan
alone were in the west with sections ranging as far afield as
Damergu and Elakkos. A little research makes it clear that both the
Kel Azañieres and the Kel Tafidet are “Kel name” sections of older
“I name” tribes; in the course of time they became so powerful and
numerous that their parent stems were obscured. Of the latter three
main stocks can still be traced, in addition to the Ikazkazan,
certain unattached Imghad tribes, and several settled communities.
The three parent tribes bear the names of Imaslagha, Igermaden, and
Imasrodang.</p>
<p>The Imaslagha include the important Kel Azañieres tribes of the
Azañieres mountains in the extreme north-west of Air, as well as
the Kel Assarara of the north-eastern plain. When the Kel Owi
entered Air, this stock occupied the area of the Immikitan and
Imezegzil tribes of earlier Tuareg known as the People of the
King.<a id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class=
"fnanchor">[270]</a> It contains several ancient “I name” sections
which might also be considered as separate stocks, were it not that
on the one hand they never<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_304">[304]</span> split up into “Kel name” tribes associated
with definite localities, and, on the other, that they continued to
be traditionally connected with the parent Imaslagha stems until
to-day. These “I tribes” are the Izeyyakan, who are also said to be
People of the King and may in fact have been a part of the latter
division absorbed by the Kel Owi, the Imarsutan, and the now almost
extinct Igururan, represented by one surviving section, the Kel
Fares, who take their name from Fares water and pasture in the far
north of North-eastern Air on the edge of the desert. If the
Izeyyakan were originally People of the King, their absorption
would afford a precedent for a similar process which can be
observed in progress among the Immikitan who have fallen under the
political influence of the Imaslagha stock of tribes. The Imarsutan
are said to have come from an unidentified place called Arsu, which
is presumed not to be in Air. In popular parlance all these tribes
have collectively come to be known as the Kel Azañieres, but,
although of the same Imaslagha stock, the Kel Assarara are usually
not included under this head. The Kel Assarara with the
subdivision, Kel Agwau and Kel Igululof, were the people of Annur,
the paramount chief of Air in Barth’s day. Their villages are along
the great valley of North-eastern Air, for which the Tuareg have no
one name. They call the valley after the various villages on its
banks, and these in turn are named from the neighbouring
tributaries. It is into this basin that the Assode Agoras flows.
The Kel Assarara fall into a somewhat separate category from the
Kel Azañieres because Annur had made them into a powerful people,
his own position being in reality far greater than either that of
the Amenokal or the Añastafidet. It was due to him that his tribe
acquired independent status in genealogical systems. Barth gives a
good picture of the chief, and it is worth reproducing as the
impression of a traveller who had no reason to be prejudiced in
favour of the Air Tuareg, having at that time recently been
attacked and nearly massacred by them.<a id=
"FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class=
"fnanchor">[271]</a> “We saw the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_305">[305]</span> old chief on the day following our arrival.
He received us in a straightforward and kindly manner, observing
very simply that even if, as Christians, we had come to his country
stained with guilt, the many dangers and difficulties we had gone
through would have sufficed to wash us clean, and that we had
nothing to fear but the climate and the thieves. The presents we
spread out before him he received graciously, but without saying a
single word. Of hospitality he showed no sign. All this was
characteristic. We soon received further explanations. Some days
afterwards he sent us the simple and unmistakable message that if
we wished to proceed to the Sudan at our own risk, he would place
no obstacle in our way; but if we wanted him to go with us and
protect us, we ought to pay him a considerable sum. In stating
these plain terms he made use of a very expressive simile saying
that as the ‘leffa’ (or snake) killed everything she touched, so
his word, when it had once escaped his lips, had terminated the
matter in question—there was nothing more to be said. . . . Having
observed Annur’s dealings to the very last, and having arrived
under his protection safely at Katsena, I must pronounce him a
straightforward and trustworthy man, who stated his terms plainly
and dryly, but stuck to them with scrupulosity (<em>sic</em>); and
as he did not treat us, neither did he ask anything from us, nor
allowed his people to do so. I shall never forgive him for his
niggardliness in not offering me so much as a drink of ‘fura’ or
‘ghussub water’ when I visited him, in the heat of the day, on his
little estate near Tasawa, but I cannot withhold from him my esteem
both as a great politician in his curious little empire, and as a
man remarkable for singleness of word and purpose.”</p>

</div>
<p>Annur was killed in 1856 by raiders from Bilma, which he had
frequently attacked. As another example of a similar type of chief,
I will copy the entry made in my diary when Ahodu and Sidi
described to me Annur’s successor, Belkho of Ajiru, chief of the
Igermaden during the last years of the nineteenth century. “He was
the last independent<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_306">[306]</span> ruler of Air. He was small and rather
hunched, but with authority unquestioned from Ghat to the Sudan.
His raids were swift, well planned and executed in a manner which
betrayed imagination. He had a great reputation for generosity,
combined with personal magnetism of such a remarkable nature that
his power was believed to be derived from communing with the
spirits. ‘We used,’ said Sidi, ‘to see him sitting near the fire at
night when he was travelling or raiding, crouched with his back
turned on his companions, saying no word, but looking into the
darkness with the firelight flickering on his small form, casting
shadows in the distance, where his friends among the spirits sat
and conferred with him!’”</p>
<p>Belkho’s people, the Igermaden, are the parent stock of the Kel
Tafidet, who not only became the most distinguished tribe in the
Confederation, but also gave their name to the administrative ruler
of the Kel Owi and the Confederation generally. They inherited the
Tafidet mountains in the easternmost parts of Air and include an
old “I name” tribe, the Igademawen. The name Igermaden seems to
associate them with Jerma or Garama in the Fezzan, but I am aware
of no particular reasons for supposing that they came to Air from
there, though it may once have been theirs in the remote past.
There are, incidentally, numerous names of places in Air containing
the root ‘Germa’ in their composition.</p>
<p>The third group of the Kel Owi, the Imasrodang, occupied the
Ighazar valley and villages, whence they drove the Kel Ferwan.
Certain small nuclei of People of the King, however, remained in
this area, as we have seen also occurred elsewhere. The Imasrodang
deserve no particular comment except that a section, the Kel
T’intaghoda, is reputed to be “holy.” There is no justification in
their conduct for the description. They are the lords of the
servile people of Tamgak, as well as of the so-called “Wild Men of
Air.”</p>
<p>I never succeeded in seeing these curious people. Their origin
is a deep mystery. Buchanan on his first journey ran across a party
of them in Northern Air, but they come down<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_307">[307]</span> very seldom from Tamgak and betray the
utmost nervousness of any strangers. The Tuareg call them
Immedideran and admit that they are noble, though not of their own
race. They emphatically deny that these people are negroid. They
are said to speak a language which the Tuareg do not understand.
When they meet any Tuareg they are reputed, probably quite untruly,
to hold their noses as if to indicate that they smelled a bad or at
any rate a curious smell. According to Sidi, who has seen them,
they live in Tamgak in a very primitive state, wearing hardly any
clothes except a few rags or skins. They nevertheless all affect
the Veil, but although they possess many sheep and goats, the camel
seems strange and unfamiliar to them when they come down to the
valleys to sell their animals. They live neither in houses nor in
huts nor in tents, but in very low shelters made of three uprights
of stone or wood, with a fire in front and a roof of skins or
grass. The Tuareg know nothing of their origin, but say that they
were there before the Veiled People came. They are apparently as
fair as the Tuareg themselves, and not negroid in type, but who
they are it is not possible even to surmise, unless they are the
Leucæthiopians of the classics.</p>

<p>The Ikazkazan group are the junior partners of the Kel Owi, but
probably the most numerous group in the Confederation of the
Children of Tafidet. They range as far south as Elakkos, which
sometimes makes one wonder if they are perhaps a non-Kel Owi tribe
which threw in its lot with these people when they entered Air.
Their many tribes are grouped into two main divisions, the Kel
Tamat (the People of the Acacia) in the north, and the Kel Ulli
(the People of the Goats) in the south, both of which appellations
are in the nature of distinctive nicknames to distinguish the two
geographical units. The names may have a totemic significance, in
which case the Kel Tagei (the People of the Dûm Palm) and Kel
Intirza (the People of the Asclepias) could be cited as other
examples of the practice. There is no particular reason for calling
the People of the Goats by this name, since they own as many camels
as do the other Tuareg<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_308">[308]</span> and are not in any way the only tribe to
keep goats. Their occupation of Elakkos is reputed, probably
rightly, to be fairly recent. The most important tribe of the
northern section is the Kel Gharus (the People of the Deep Well) in
Talak—with their dependent Imghad, the Ahaggaren.</p>
<p>Such, briefly, is the Kel Owi tribal system. From Assode I
determined to examine their country in the great north-eastern
basin of Air contained between the mountain groups of Afis,
Taghmeurt, Azañieres and Tafidet. Somewhere in this area clearly
was the village and valley of T’intellust where Annur lived and
where Barth’s expedition made its head-quarters in Air. The name
does not figure on the French maps, and since such indications as I
had received from native sources seemed to be confused, I was
determined to find it for myself.</p>
<p>The country east of Assode was a broken plain, out of which only
one small massif emerged, the Gundai<a id=
"FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class=
"fnanchor">[272]</a> hills, standing isolated and compact against
the background of the eastern mountains. Between Gundai and T’imia
the country is drained by the Unankara valley, which is crossed by
the trans-Saharan caravan road on its way from the Ighazar to Mount
Mari. The watering-point of Unankara lies below Gundai opposite the
Talat Mellen hills: from there a branch off the Tarei tan Kel Owi
runs up to T’imia village by a very difficult road along a
watercourse which is the upper part of the Assode Agoras. Whenever
in the south-eastern plain I crossed the main Kel Owi road and
plotted the point on a map compiled from my compass traverse, I was
impressed by the directness and straightness of its course across
country. From Mount Mari southward the line was almost due north
and south; at that point a change of direction takes place, and a
line drawn somewhat west of north from Mount Mari to Unankara and
produced, would, as the road does, pass within a short distance of
Assatartar and enter the Ighazar between T’intaghoda and Iferuan.
The upper part of the great caravan road in Air is as straight as
the southern section<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_309">[309]</span> across the Azawagh and Damergu. Great age
alone can account for the directness of the road and the worn
tracks on the rocky ground. Its conquest and tenure by the Kel Owi
is only an episode in the history of one of the oldest roads in the
world.</p>
<p>Leaving three men with my baggage at Assode to take care of
themselves, Sidi and I on two camels set out to look for
T’intellust, which he had often visited in his younger days. I
passed one or two small settlements of stone houses, including
Assadoragan, near Assode, and T’in Wansa, and reached Igululof
after crossing or ascending a number of small valleys which flowed
from Gundai into the Agoras. Igululof is a largish village with a
date grove and the remains of some gardens; the houses were nearly
all of the “B type” and were still filled with the household
effects of the inhabitants who had evacuated the country in 1918.
Apart from the usual collections of skins for water and grain,
mortars, saddle-stone querns and pottery, the frequent occurrence
of beds and furniture deserves mention as indicating the prosperity
of the communities in the past. One also saw here, as elsewhere in
these northern villages, swinging doors hewn out of one piece of
wood set in stone sockets. The trees from which they were cut must
certainly have been four feet in diameter, a few such were still to
be seen in all the larger valleys. In one house I remarked a wooden
bridle stand with a broadening top like the capital of a column
surmounted by four wooden horns, on which were hung looped bridle
ropes and halters. There were examples of low kidney-shaped or
rectangular seats standing not four inches from the ground cut out
of blocks of wood: they were used by the women when preparing food,
and constituted the nearest approach to a chair in a country where
it is the universal custom to sit on mats on the ground. Many of
the houses had long rectangular racks of palm ribs up to 10 ft. × 5
ft. × 1 ft. deep slung from the roof, with the household effects,
which they were intended to contain, still in their places. The
niches were filled with the pots and skins<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_310">[310]</span> and trinkets of the former owners. The
spectacle of desolation produced by these pathetic human remains
made one sympathise profoundly with the unfortunate people who had
had no time even to save their few worldly goods.</p>
<p>By far the most important household implement appeared to be the
double luggage rest which was conspicuous in all the houses. It
consists of a pair of <span class="sym">U</span>-shaped wooden
crutches on a short round pole, which is planted in the ground. The
upper or <span class="sym">U</span>-part of these rests, in the
ordinary variety, has plain flat surfaces some four inches broad by
a half-inch thick. The elaborate variety has a broader front member
which spreads gradually from some four inches at the base, where it
joins the round pole or leg, to a breadth of twelve to fifteen
inches. The tops of these members are flat or stepped down in the
centre, so as to make the corners appear like wide projecting
horns. Their front surfaces were very elaborately ornamented with
brass ribs and silver, lead or zinc studs. The brass was nailed on
or hammered into the surface of the wood as an inlay. Brass sheet
fretted in patterns with green leather or red stuff behind it
covered the larger spaces. The designs were geometrical and
somewhat analogous to the ornamentation on the camel saddles, but
rather more varied. The workmanship was excellent and displayed the
most finished craft in Air. These rests were traditionally used in
pairs on the march to keep valuable merchandise and baggage out of
the wet. Their great weight—as they measure up to 5 ft. high and 2
ft. 6 in. between tops of the arms, and are always cut in one piece
from a log of hard wood—in practice rendered it impossible to use
them much on the road, and they have consequently become articles
of household furniture. So far as I know, both the shape of the
objects themselves and the designs which ornament them are
traditional and peculiar to the Tuareg.</p>

<p>In view of their having been so recently inhabited and being at
the same time so similar to the older “A type” houses, these houses
were very interesting, as they showed the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_311">[311]</span> mode of life of the earlier Tuareg. Within,
the floors were neatly sprinkled with sand or small quartz gravel;
two rings of stones containing coarser pebbles marked the places
where personal ablutions were performed or where rubbish was
collected. A group of large stones represented the hearth. The
absence of windows and the lower roofs and doors make the more
recent houses seem rather dark, but otherwise they are quite
pleasant dwellings. The older houses must have been most
comfortable. Their cleanliness, as early travellers remarked,
depended on the owners: judging by the state of their present-day
huts they were very well kept.</p>
<p>Crossing to the north of the broad Igululof valley, Sidi and I
entered a very rough plateau covered with large ochreous and brown
boulders; it was intersected by numerous small valleys and gullies
flowing north into the main basin. We climbed laboriously over a
steep ravine and up a pass between two hillocks where there was a
way down into the further valley of Anu Samed.<a id=
"FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class=
"fnanchor">[273]</a> It was already late in the evening and the sun
was setting on our left: in front the whole plain of the basin of
North-eastern Air was spread out with a great green and white snake
of a bed winding through it. In the distance along the horizon were
the fantastic purple mountains which reach from Tamgak to Tafidet
along the edge of the desert. We descended slowly in the dusk into
the Anu Samed ravine, and lay down to sleep where this tributary
enters the stream bed of the nameless basin. Night came on
immediately. I made some cocoa, but we had to put out the fire as
soon as possible, for this is the way by which raiding parties
enter Air from the east. There is no permanent habitation nearer
than T’imia or Iferuan, fifty miles away to the south and west
respectively. The country was impressive and rather
frightening.</p>
<p>Next morning I said I wanted to go to T’intellust. We set off up
the main valley in an east to north-easterly direction; it was
filled with big trees and had a series of small villages on either
bank. After riding for some hours Sidi<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_312">[312]</span> turned to me and asked me if I wanted to go
to T’intellust village or to the House of the Christians. I
supposed the latter was some old French Camel Corps camp, but
expressed mild curiosity about it. I asked him why, particularly,
it was so called. Sidi replied that in the olden days when his
father was alive, he had told him that some Christians had come to
the valley and had lived with the chief Annur. This interesting
information decided me to make for the House of the Christians,
which proved to be not so very far from T’intellust village itself,
a settlement of “B type” stone houses with a few enclosures and
brushwood huts. It lay on the north side of the great bed, which
here was several hundred yards broad and contained many large trees
between various flood channels. As we approached a group of large
trees south of the village I saw some piles of brushwood. They
turned out to be the ruins of two thatch huts. I dismounted,
tethered the camels and again questioned Sidi, who repeated his
story, adding that the Christians were three white men of whom he
supposed I knew, for they had not been French. Because they were
great men and friends of Annur their houses had neither been
inhabited nor pulled down since they went away. Their dwellings had
been left slowly to decay, but not before the place had been called
after them, the House of the Christians.</p>
<p>Sidi had vouchsafed this information unsolicited; he had no idea
of what I was coming to seek. There is no doubt that the ruined
huts are the remains of the camp occupied by Barth and his
companions in 1850. When they reached T’intellust after narrowly
escaping massacre at T’intaghoda, they had camped on a low hill to
the south of the village where Annur himself was living. Another
attack, by robbers this time, took place there, and for greater
safety they moved their camp rather nearer to his village. It was
this second camp which I saw.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>Little remains to-day of the falling huts. There was a small
wooden drinking-trough and a semicircle of stones to mark the east,
to which their servants knelt in prayer. Three-quarters<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span> of a century have passed and
gone, but their camp has never been touched, “because they were the
friends of Annur,” who had given them his word that they would be
safe in Air. Barth’s speculation was fulfilled when he said: “This
spot being once selected the tents were soon pitched, and in a
short time there rose the little encampment of the English
expedition. . . . Doubtless this said hill will ever remain
memorable in the annals of the Asbenawa as the ‘English Hill,’ or
the ‘Hill of the Christians.’”<a id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> And so it has come to
pass. The site induced in me a justifiable glow of pride. Her
Majesty’s Government had sent the first successful expedition to
Air. A German, Heinrich Barth, assisted by another compatriot of
his, had been Richardson’s companions. Their memory survives in the
land as the white men who were not French and who did not come as
conquerors but as the friends of Annur. In the light of history,
the broad-mindedness of the statesman who selected a German to
assist Richardson in his work on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government
is only less worthy of praise than the loyalty with which Barth
carried out his task when lesser men would have considered
themselves free to return to Europe after accomplishing only a
fraction of what he achieved.</p>

<p>Neither T’intellust nor Oborassan, a little further up the
valley, deserve any special mention. Annur had houses in both
villages, though his official residence was in the latter. They are
small settlements of a nomadic people, dependent upon camels and
goats for sustenance, and lie near the point where the great valley
receives the waters of Gundai by a large tributary from the south.
The west side of the mountains of Tafidet also drain into the main
basin, the upper part of which eventually turns north-east towards
the Taghmeurt n’Afara hills. These mountains are the last barrier
which divide the plateau of Air from the desert. The plain north of
T’intellust and the right bank of the valley bed are
low,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> rocky and
devoid of vegetation. Along the western side of the plain runs the
Agwau valley. Agwau village, marked by a white hillock, is the
principal settlement of the Kel Agwau section of the Kel Assarara
tribe in the Imaslagha group of the Kel Owi. It boasts a number of
houses of the “B type,” a small mosque, a few “A type” dwellings
and many large circles which were once hut enclosures.</p>
<p>Marching west from Oborassan and T’intellust towards Agwau,
there were few landmarks of any note along the north side of the
main valley. I gradually left the line of the main bed and skirted
some low rocky ground, which reaches for some distance towards the
north. Beyond Agwau I crossed a grassy plain in the direction of a
big group of bare mountains, one side of which is called the
Assarara and the other the Afis massif;<a id=
"FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class=
"fnanchor">[275]</a> it is an isolated southern spur of the great
Tamgak formation just visible behind it in the north-west. The
Agwau torrent flows down between its eastern side and the plain of
North-eastern Air. A road from the great nameless valley runs
northwards up its course and eventually leaves the mountains for
the desert by Fares and T’iwilmas watering-points.</p>
<p>The most important settlement of this north-eastern basin of Air
is Assarara, a small town lying in a cranny between two
boulder-strewn peaks which rise suddenly out of the gentle slope of
the northern bank of the main valley. Here I spent a night after
looting a number of ethnological specimens from deserted houses,
mainly of the “B type.” The dwellings were all well built and were
still filled with abandoned household goods: several had stucco
decorations derived from the older “A type” house decoration which
has already been described. There were also a mosque and khan.
Thence I returned to Assode by Assatartar village, crossing the
Tarei tan Kel Owi as it emerges from the plateau south of the main
valley by the little left bank ravine called Azañieres.<a id=
"FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class=
"fnanchor">[276]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>By the next day
I had again set forth towards the north, halting after the first
march at Afis village, not far from Assarara, but on the other side
of the Afis massif. There also I saw a number of stone houses and
another mosque. The country in a sense was dangerous, because the
neighbouring watering-point called Agaragar, has often proved to be
the favourite camping-ground for raiders entering Air from the
north. It happened while I was taking an astronomical observation
during the night at about 1 a.m. that a sudden wind arose in the
valley, and the camp woke up with a sense of foreboding. The air
seemed filled with impending danger, of which the camels also
became aware. Almost at once a camel was seen silhouetted on a
ridge against the dark sky. Amadu, my servant, seized a rifle and
quickly but silently woke up Sidi and the camel men. They said that
a raid was upon us, and with difficulty I restrained them from
firing indiscriminately into the night. We took up our positions
behind the baggage in the black shadow of a tree under which we
were camped. But the camel on the sky-line turned out to be one of
my own beasts which had strayed, and calm was restored. We had
received a visitation from the great god Pan.</p>
<p>On the following day we crossed the Agaragar valley and wound
slowly up a defile towards the upper part of the Ighazar basin. We
climbed to a pass over a spur of the Tamgak mountains. The rocks
all round were covered with drawings and inscriptions, for the way
was very old. It was the road of the Northern Air salt caravan
which went to Bilma from Iferuan by Faodet, Agwau, Taghmeurt
n’Afara and the pool of Agamgam on the edge of the desert in the
far north-eastern corner of the mountains. From Agamgam the caravan
used to march by an easier route than the southern track which is
now followed to Ashegur well, north of Fashi and from that place to
Bilma.</p>
<p>From the pass the road fell steeply to Faodet in an amphitheatre
of great hills, a picturesque place, and important on account of a
good, deep well. Although the houses were<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_316">[316]</span> few the site proved interesting by reason
of the existence of rectangular grass huts constructed at great
labour to preserve the traditional type of the Tuareg house. They
provided an excellent example of the tenacity of custom, for the
material of which they had been built was totally unsuited to their
shape or plan.</p>
<p>The upper waters of the Ighazar basin collect in three valleys
which unite between T’intaghoda and Seliufet. On the way down the
valley from Faodet, the village and palm grove of Iberkom were
passed, whence a fine valley runs up into the heart of Tamgak and
provides some degree of communication between T’iwilmas or Fares on
the desert, and the villages in the Ighazar. Further on we come to
Tanutmolet village, remarkable for a modern elaboration of the “B
type” house displayed in the strictly rectangular but many-roomed
dwelling shown in <a href="#i27">Plate 27.</a> T’intaghoda is
interesting as possessing an early mosque and several fine “A” and
“B type” houses covered with a stucco of red earth. Most of the
houses had been built on two low hills standing in the bottom of
the valley. There are no gardens near them nor any palm grove. The
importance of the merchants and holy men who used to live there had
made of T’intaghoda the capital of Northern Air. A little further
on begins the palm grove of Seliufet, and from there date palms and
gardens continue all the way to Iferuan, with a chain of almost
contiguous settlements on both sides of the valley bed.</p>
<p>At Iferuan the French established a small fort in 1921 near the
site where the Foureau-Lamy expedition had camped and had been
attacked some twenty years before. The fort is valueless except for
the moral support it may offer to induce the local Tuareg to return
to their old villages from the south. The Senegalese soldiers of
the garrison are not mounted and would be powerless to do anything
in the event of a raid. By the end of 1922 some families, but only
a few compared with the numbers who lived there before the war, had
returned to their homes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>Iferuan was a
very delightful place. The peak of Tamgak stands pointing like a
finger to heaven on the edge of the massif. The gardens and the
groves of palm trees, some of which, alas! have died through lack
of attention during the years of neglect since 1917, give the area
a distinctly fertile aspect. It is impossible to say how many palm
trees there are in the Ighazar, but they must run into many
thousands. There are said to be 4250 at Iferuan alone. This number
exceeds the next largest single group at In Gall west of Agades,
where there are some 4000 trees, and the former are only a part of
the total in the Ighazar.</p>
<p>The date palm is a comparatively late arrival in Air, where it
was introduced from the north. The trees are a cross of the Medina
and Fezzan varieties. As elsewhere in North Africa, each tree is an
immovable asset like a house, and often does not belong to the same
man as the ground on which it is grown.</p>
<p>At the foot of the palms were numerous gardens growing
vegetables and grain. The fort had a wonderful kitchen garden with
all sorts of melons, gourds and welcome European green food. The
French officer in command of the post used to declare that Iferuan
was the Switzerland of the Sahara, and the cool climate seemed to
justify his praise. The Tuareg buildings had nothing remarkable
about them with the exception of the large mosque of Tefgun not far
away, and the khan or caravanserai built on the Arab plan. The
Sudanese habit of making large clay amphoræ and baking them <em>in
situ</em>, for the storage of wheat and millet grown in the
gardens, has been adopted in Iferuan, and to my knowledge not
elsewhere in Air.</p>
<p>Although the open desert on the way to Ghat is not reached much
before In Azawa, several days further north, now, as in the past,
Iferuan is the last permanently inhabited point in Northern Air.
Between these points the mountain mass of Fadé has first to be
crossed; it contains several watering-points and some pastures, and
huts were occasionally built at a pool called Zelim, but they had
no permanence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> The
mountains and the watering-places have long since been abandoned by
their old owners, the Ifadeyen and Kel Fadé and now belong to the
Ikazkazan and Kel Tadek tribes.</p>
<p>At Iferuan several important roads meet. The road from Air to
Tuat and to Ghat, which is the main north and south caravan track
across the Central Sahara, and the Haj road from Timbuctoo to
Cairo, all three have a stage in common from Iferuan to In Azawa.
The Haj road used to leave the Niger at Gao and enter Air at In
Gall, whence it skirted the western edge of the plateau and then
turned into the mountains to Iferuan: after passing In Azawa and
Ghat it ran through Murzuk, Aujila and Siwa to Cairo. From Iferuan
there are also several roads to the west, while the northern of the
two alternative eastern roads across the desert to Kawar equally
started from there, running, as already stated, by way of Taghmeurt
n’Afara, Agamgam and Ashegur.</p>
<p>In seeking to identify Air with the Agisymba Regio of the Roman
geographers, Duveyrier presumed that the Fezzanian Garamantes were
in the habit of visiting the plateau in ox-drawn chariots or
wagons. If they had, in fact, done so, it is logical to suppose the
road they used would have come to Iferuan or one of the Ighazar
villages. Indeed he states that he heard rumours of a direct road
from Murzuk or Garama to Air, a “Garamantian way” which passed
through a place called Anai, where there were rock drawings similar
to those found in Algeria and Tripolitania. This Anai was
south-west of Murzuk and must not be mistaken for the better known
Anai of Kawar, which is north of Bilma on the Murzuk-Chad road.</p>
<p>I was at particular pains to inquire into the existence of this
road from all the most prominent guides and personages in Air whom
I could find. It would have been peculiarly interesting to
establish its existence, for Duveyrier says, “<em>La voie, avec ses
anciennes ornières</em>, est encore assez caractérisée pour que les
Tebou, mes informateurs, qui en arrivaient, n’aient laissé dans mon
esprit aucun doute à ce<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_319">[319]</span> sujet.”<a id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Other writers,
presumably on his authority, have added that where this road
crossed the sand, stone flags were laid for the wheels to pass
over. Duveyrier’s informers stated that the petroglyphs at Anai
represented ox-drawn vehicles, and that the road also passed by way
of Telizzarhen, where Barth discovered the famous rock drawings
depicting men with animal heads.<a id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> While the broad valley
at T’intellust would afford easy passage for a wheeled vehicle,
there is no way to the south for any but pack transport. There are
no signs of any road for vehicles ever having existed either east
or west of the Bagezan massif. The great Kel Owi road is only fit
for pack animals; and although many parallel tracks are visible in
the open country there are numerous defiles where a single path
only a few inches broad occurs. I am convinced that wheeled
transport could never have been used anywhere in Central or
Southern Air. But, it may be asked, could chariots have arrived
even as far as T’intellust or Iferuan? There are only three ways
into the plateau from the north-east that are at all suitable even
for loaded camels. They are (<em>a</em>) through the Fadé mountains
to Iferuan, (<em>b</em>) by Fares water and the Agwau valley to the
great north-east basin, and by Taghmeurt n’Afara to T’intellust.
The first two are not practicable for wheeled traffic, and on
hearsay evidence the third one is equally out of the question. I do
not, therefore, think that wheeled transport could ever even have
entered Air from the north or north-east, though wagons might, of
course, have come as far as the borders of the mountains to points
such as Fares or Agamgam, provided the surface of the desert were
hard enough. This cannot be determined until Anai and the country
between it and Air have been visited.</p>
<p>If any direct road between these areas ever existed, it
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> very unlikely to
have run straight from Anai to T’intellust, as Duveyrier’s map
shows. In my inquiries I heard in all of only four roads across the
Eastern Desert: (<em>a</em>) the southernmost from Damagarim by
Termit;<a id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class=
"fnanchor">[279]</a> (<em>b</em>) the direct road to Fashi and
Bilma from Southern Air, starting at Tabello; (<em>c</em>) the old
Kel Owi Taghalam road from Agamgam to Ashegur, whence one branch
goes north to Jado oasis and the other south to Fashi; and
(<em>d</em>) a northern road from Fadé to Jado direct. Guides like
Efale, who know every part of the Eastern Desert, state that there
is no road from Air direct to Murzuk which does not go either by
way of Jado or by way of the usual caravan road between Kawar and
the Fezzan. The northernmost road from Fadé to Jado runs through
two places called Booz and Ghudet, where water is found a short way
below the surface; Efale travelled this way in his youth. He told
me that it was known to and used by Tebu raiders to-day. But there
are no deep wells on this track to be filled up to prevent raiders
passing down the old Garamantian way, as Duveyrier implies was
done. From Jado it, of course, is possible to reach Murzuk either
by Anai or by joining the usual Chad road via Tummo. The existence
of this northern Anai is certainly substantiated, and Jado, a Tebu
oasis with a palm grove, is known to exist. It is called by this
name among the Arabs, but Agewas by the Tuareg of Air and Braun by
the Tebu themselves. The place has been reconnoitred by certain
French officers, one of whom, a commandant of the fort of Bilma, I
had the good fortune to meet. He was aware of the story of a
flagged road, but after visiting Jado several times found no trace
of any such track and did not believe in its existence. That the
Garamantes and, indeed, other inhabitants of the Fezzan at one
period in history used chariots drawn by oxen is quite likely, but
it is highly improbable that they ever ventured so far afield in
them as Air.</p>
<p>The existence of a road between Air and the Fezzan may be
admitted as possible, but only on condition that it is
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span> made to run
direct between these countries. South of Anai it would almost
certainly pass through Jado, and thence may have reached the
plateau either by Ghudet and Booz to a water-point called
Temed<a id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class=
"fnanchor">[280]</a> on the eastern edge of Fadé north of the
Tamgak group, or else by Ashegur and Agamgam north-east of
T’intellust. This is not the road of the Garamantes on Duveyrier’s
map; and beyond this his story cannot be further substantiated. As
against this line of argument it must be observed that Von
Bary<a id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class=
"fnanchor">[281]</a> during this stay in Air collected information
which led him to believe that there was a road from Air to Jerma by
way of Anai. It is implied that it went direct, but he was never
able to learn any details and was probably influenced by
Duveyrier’s statements. He heard that there were some traces
visible, but found no evidence to confirm the report of flagstones,
wheel-marks or sculpture along its course.</p>
<p>There is nevertheless one piece of evidence which militates in
some measure against my belief that chariots never were seen in
Air, and that is a rock drawing which I found in Air on a boulder
in the Anu Maqaran valley just west of Mount Arwa. The drawing is
reproduced in <a href="#i41">Plate 41.</a> In the conventional
manner adopted in these designs it represents oxen pulling
four-wheeled vehicles. The identification of the ox is confirmed
from the many other similar pictures of this animal on rocks in
Air. The object behind it must apparently be a cart. The whiteness
of the marks in the Anu Maqaran drawing appears to indicate that it
is a comparatively recent production, although the colour and
degree of patination of Saharan drawings are of course no real
criteria, for weathering is notoriously uneven in its action. Near
the drawing of the ox and chariot, but on a different boulder, was
the magic square shown in the same figure. Both drawings were in a
very sheltered place and seemed contemporary. The evidence of this
picture of the chariot or<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_322">[322]</span> wagon is too unreliable and slender to
establish any theory, but it is certainly difficult to understand
where the draughtsman obtained his idea except as a result of
seeing chariots drawn by oxen, a condition which does not, I think,
obtain in the Fezzan to-day. Wheeled vehicles have only been known
in the Sudan since they were imported by Europeans during the last
twenty years, and I am not aware that even those are ox-drawn.
Furthermore, although the most puzzling point about the Anu Maqaran
rock drawing is its apparent modernity, which is paradoxical in
view of the disuse of wheeled vehicles in the Sahara, it is almost
certainly older than this century. Yet the application of an ox to
a cart is not likely to have been imagined by any Tuareg who had
not seen an instance of it, and there seems to be no adequate
reason for him to reproduce his knowledge on a rock in Air even if
chance had taken him so far afield as the Mediterranean littoral,
where he might have seen the equipage, unless it had in some way
become associated with Air.</p>
<p>The identification of Air with the Agisymba Regio of the Romans
has been accepted by many authorities other than Duveyrier. It
raises the whole problem of the Roman penetration of the Sahara.
They are known to have administered the Fezzan, and it is even
pretended that they reached the Niger, but evidence on this point
is more scanty. Doubtless as the exploration of the Central Sahara
is carried out systematically further evidence of their penetration
will come to light. I am, for instance, not aware that any remains
have actually been found at Ghat, though the city, which was known
to them as Rapsa, was almost certainly that place and was visited
in 19 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> by Cornelius Balbus. The Roman
remains discovered by Barth on the road from Mizda over the Hammada
el Homra to Murzuk are better known. This route seems to have been
opened about the time of the Emperor Vespasian, and to have
rendered possible or at least easier the occupation of the Fezzan,
which had, however, already been visited by military expeditions
earlier than that reign. Pliny writes: “Ad Garamantes iter
inexplicabile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
<em>adhuc</em> fuit. Proximo bello, quod cum Œensibus Romani
gessere auspiciis Vespasiani Imperatoris, compendium viæ quatridui
deprehensum est. Hoc iter vocatur ‘Præter caput saxæ.’” Evidently
the road was called by the natives, even in those days, by the same
name which it now possesses, for the Pass over the Red Rock Desert
at 1568 feet above the sea is still known to the Arabs as “Bab Ras
el Hammada.”<a id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class=
"fnanchor">[282]</a> In about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
100<a id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class=
"fnanchor">[283]</a> Septimius Flaccus penetrated from the Fezzan
into Æthiopia at the head of a Roman column; Julius Maternus
marching from some point on the coast to Garama had joined forces
with the Garamantes in order to proceed southward together against
various Æthiopian bands. By this date, then, it is probable that an
occupation of the Fezzan had been accomplished, for this alone
would justify a further advance or punitive expeditions on such a
scale against raiders from the south. Indeed, from the account
given by Pliny<a id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284"
class="fnanchor">[284]</a> of Cornelius Balbus’ expedition of 19
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> to the Fezzan, it might be supposed
that the occupation of Southern Tripolitania and the Central Sahara
had taken place a century earlier. The identification of the cities
conquered by Balbus has not been satisfactory except in the case of
Cydamus, Cillaba or Cilliba, Tabudium,<a id=
"FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class=
"fnanchor">[285]</a> Rapsa and Jerma, respectively Ghadames,
Zuila,<a id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class=
"fnanchor">[286]</a> Tabonie, Ghat and Garama; the last named being
the capital of the Garamantes and of the whole Fezzan, a position
which later passed on to other places and finally to Murzuk.</p>
<p>These operations of Septimius Flaccus and Julius Maternus have
been held to concern Air. The latter, ἀπὸ Γαράμης ἅμα τῷ βασιλεῖ
τῶν Γαραμαντίων ἐπερχομένῳ τοῖς Αἰθιόψιν ὁδεύσαντα τὰ πάντα πρὸς
μεσημβρίαν μησὶ τέσσαρσι ἀφικέσθαι εἰς τὴν Ἀγίσυμβα. . . .<a id=
"FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class=
"fnanchor">[287]</a> It is important to try to identify<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> the area, since it appears to
be the most southerly point to which Roman geographical knowledge
is recorded as having extended. Duveyrier, arguing, on what may in
any case be a false premise, that because Pliny mentions no camels
in Africa there were no camels, concludes with the fantastic
statement that the Romans must have used wheeled transport on their
expeditions, and that that is why the “Iter præter caput saxæ”
played such an important part in their operations; but I have seen
no evidence which might lead one to suppose that this route over
the Hammada el Homra was fit for wheeled traffic. The Garamantes
were said by Herodotus to have used wagons drawn by four
horses.<a id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class=
"fnanchor">[288]</a> From this Duveyrier concludes that at a later
date oxen were substituted for horses, and that in virtue of a
perfectly imaginary road from Murzuk by way of Anai Air must be the
Agisymba Regio. He gives no convincing reason for the
identification, but implies that by a process of elimination it
must be so. The name Agisymba and Bagezan have been connected by
displacing the terminal and initial syllables respectively of the
two words, but undoubtedly it was not this so much as the existence
of a Garamantian road which appealed to the learned author.</p>
<p>One of the principal objectives which I had in mind in visiting
Air was to seek evidence of Roman penetration. In the course of
their long historical knowledge and occupation of the Fezzan, it
seemed natural for the Romans to have explored the Air road. But I
found no remains, nor evidence whatsoever of their penetration, not
even at points which had considerable strategic value. Some more
fortunate traveller than myself may one day chance upon an
inscription or a camp. Such a discovery in so vast and little known
a land is quite conceivable, but up till now the weight of evidence
is against the Romans ever having come to Air. There is a certain
historical analogy in the fact that the Arabs never invaded the
country either. Their influence on the Tuareg of Air was confined
to an unenthusiastic conversion to Islam<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_325">[325]</span> in comparatively recent times. On the other
hand, the Arabs in the first century of the Hijra, like the Romans,
seem to have descended the Chad road at least as far as Bilma, and
again, Arab influence in Central Africa east of the lake is at
least as strong as, and perhaps even greater than, the Western
Arab-Moorish influence on the Upper Niger.</p>
<p>I am, however, much more inclined to regard Tibesti and not Air
as the Agisymba Regio. We find the Arabs in the Fezzan evidently
feeling the same necessity of expansion southwards along the Chad
road as did the Romans. By 46 <span class="sc2">A.H.</span> the
Fezzan had already twice been conquered by the Arabs, first in 26
<span class="sc2">A.H.</span>, soon after the occupation of Egypt
had been completed and the attention of Islam was turned to North
Africa, and again when the inhabitants had cast off their servitude
to the Arabs. Okba ibn Nafé was induced by this breach of
faith<a id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class=
"fnanchor">[289]</a> to leave his army, which was on its way to
conquer Ifrikiya (Tunisia and Western Algeria), at Sert in the
Great Syrtis, and to lead an expedition to reconquer the desert. He
took Wadan and Jerma, near Murzuk, and the last strong places of
the country, and asking what lay “beyond,” learnt of the “people of
Hawar,”<a id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class=
"fnanchor">[290]</a> who had a fortress on the edge of the desert
at the top of an escarpment. It was said to be the capital of a
country called Kawar, the name which is borne even to-day by the
depression along which the main caravan road passes south through
Bilma and other small villages, any one of which may have been
their stronghold, which El Bekri<a id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> also calls Jawan. After
a march of fifteen nights Okba came to this place and eventually
captured it. At one moment his expedition nearly perished of
thirst, but according to the story Okba’s horse found water in the
sand and saved the column, wherefore the place was called Ma el
Fares, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> “Water
of the Horse.” This point is now spelt Mafaras on the Murzuk-Kawar
road in about Lat. 21° 15′ N.<a id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>
<p>The Romans seem to have had much the same experience as the
Arabs, though we can identify the movements of the latter with
greater certainty. The expedition of Septimius Flaccus and Julius
Maternus started from Garama. Now an expedition from the Fezzan
proper to Negroland would normally have proceeded along the Chad
road, which runs south, and not in the direction of Air, which lies
south-west. Furthermore, we have already seen that there is no
direct road from the Fezzan to Air save by making a detour via Jado
and crossing the worst part of the desert. Had the Romans intended
to use the Air road to Negroland they would assuredly have started
from Rapsa (Ghat) and not from Garama; alternately had they started
from Garama and proceeded by way of Ghat, it is likely to have been
mentioned, nor would the enterprise have been so directly connected
with the Garamantes. After marching south from Garama the
expedition reached the Agisymba Regio. But if the Air mountains are
neither south of Garama nor on a direct road from that place, both
these conditions do apply to Tibesti. This country lies due south
of the eastern Fezzan and there is a direct road from Garama by way
of Tibesti to Negroland, though it is not so well known as the main
Chad road. The latter trade road, however, and the Tibesti
mountains seem to fit the description of the course taken by the
expedition sufficiently well, and clearly better than the Air road
and plateau. The Romans, we are told, marched for three months to
the south; it may be objected that this would be an inordinately
long time to take on a journey to Tibesti and that Air, being
somewhat further away from Garama, is the more probable. But
expeditions may take longer or shorter times to traverse any
particular desert road<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_327">[327]</span> according to the difficulties encountered,
the fighting sustained and the pasturage available on the way for
the transport animals, and I do not think that any conclusion can
be drawn from the reported length of the march. A period of three
to four months might as easily bring one expedition from the Fezzan
to Tibesti or to Air as it would be insufficient for another under
different conditions but on the same road to get more than
half-way.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>If circumstantial evidence seems to point to Tibesti, there is
also that of the place names given in the account. The Agisymba
Regio contained the mountains of Bardetus, Mesche and Zipta. No
similarity to these names can be found in Air, but in Tibesti the
first may well be the area and massif round the village of Bardai,
while Mesche may be a Latinised form of Miski, a valley and group
south-west of Bardai. For Zipta I can offer no suggestion.</p>
<p>Like the Romans and the Arabs the modern Turks also penetrated
Tibesti as a consequence of their occupation of the Fezzan in an
attempt to stop the Tebu raiding. History is curiously consistent
in that we have no evidence of the Arabs or the Turks having
penetrated Air. The Romans, I assume, probably did not do so
either.<a id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class=
"fnanchor">[293]</a></p>
<p>The Romans must have come into contact with the Tuareg in the
Fezzan, where the latter, it might be assumed from Arab evidence
alone, were early established if they did not actually constitute
the majority of the original population. It is possible to trace in
Roman records the names of certain well-known Tuareg tribes. The
description which Corippus gives of the Ifuraces, the Ifoghas tribe
of the Southern Tuareg, corresponds accurately with that of the
present-day camel riders of the Sahara. In a description of an
encounter with the Byzantine forces under John, the general himself
cuts down a camel with his sword and the rider falls with the
accoutrements and paraphernalia, which are those of a Tuareg on
campaign or in battle to-day.<a id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The
activities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span> of the
Circumcelliones during the troubles described by Opatus<a id=
"FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class=
"fnanchor">[295]</a> during the Donatist heresy in North Africa in
the course of the fourth century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
remind one irresistibly of those of the Tuareg. These bands of
marauders from the desert came into Southern Tunisia and Algeria on
swift and remorseless errands of plunder for the greater glory of
their heretical Faith. They lived in the barren hills of the outer
waste and descended to burn churches, sack houses and carry off
live-stock with such deadly efficiency and ease that the motive
power of their organisation can only have come from a spirit which
considers raiding a national sport. “When they were not resisted
they usually contented themselves with plunder, but the slightest
opposition provoked them to acts of violence and murder. . . . The
spirit of the Circumcellians, armed with a huge and weighty club,
as they were indifferently supplied with swords and spears, and
waging war to the cry of ‘Praise be to God’ . . . was not always
directed against their defenceless enemies, the peasants of the
orthodox belief; they engaged and sometimes defeated the troops of
the province, and in the bloody action of Bagai they attacked in
the open field, but with unsuccessful valour, the advance guard of
the Imperial cavalry.”<a id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
<p>So in later years the Tuareg of Ahaggar, disdaining any but
<em>les armes blanches</em>, fell in ranks under the rifle fire of
the French troops at Tit.</p>
<p>But it is curious that in none of these and other early
descriptions of the Tuareg is any mention made of their outstanding
characteristics, so obvious to the person who sees them for the
first time—the Face Veil worn by the men. It seems very strange
that none of the classical and post-classical authors should have
recorded a feature which so distinguishes these people from other
races. There is no reference to the Veil until we come to the first
Arab authors, when the whole race is immediately described by this
very peculiarity, as the Muleththemin, <span class=
"ar">ملثّمين</span>,the “Veiled Ones,”<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_329">[329]</span> a second form plural past participle from
the root <span class="ar">لثم</span>, which also forms the word
<em>litham</em>, <span class="ar">لثام</span>, the Arabic name for
the Veil itself. How it came about that the Arabs should be the
first to record the use of the Veil is a problem to which I have
been able to find no satisfactory solution.</p>

<p class="sch">THE ANCESTRY OF THE TUAREG OF AIR</p>
<p><span class="sc">After</span> the close of the classical period,
the works of that great historian and philosopher, Abu Zeid Abd el
Rahman ibn Khaldun, are our most fruitful source of information
regarding North Africa. Himself a native of North Africa, whose
inhabitants he esteemed inferior to none in the world, Ibn Khaldun
compiled a monumental <em>History of the Berbers</em>, which has
become a classic in the Arabic language. His lifetime, falling
between <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1332 and 1406, was still
sufficiently early for him to have had experience of conditions and
people before they had fallen so completely under the influence of
the Arabs as we find them a century or two later. On the subject of
the Tuareg, or Muleththemin as he calls them, the work is perhaps a
little disappointing, for the author seems to have drawn his
material from several sources; he is not wholly free from
contradictions. To avoid, however, adding unduly to the
complications attending a study of the divisions of the Tuareg in
the Central Sahara, it will be preferable in the first instance to
examine the account of another historian, Leo Africanus. Hassan ibn
Muhammad el Wezaz el Fazi or el Gharnathi, to give him his full
name, was also a North African, but born, probably in <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 1494 or 1495, at Granada. In the course of his
life he became converted to Christianity, when he relinquished his
original name. He travelled extensively in North Africa, and after
living for some time in Rome, died at Tunis in 1552.<a id=
"FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class=
"fnanchor">[297]</a></p>
<p>According to Leo,<a id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> in the interior of Libya
there was a people who wore the Litham or Veil. The nations of
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> people were
called Lemtuna, Lemta, Jedala, Targa,<a id=
"FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class=
"fnanchor">[299]</a> and Zenega; in other lists the names are given
as Zenega or Sanhaja, Zanziga or Ganziga, Targa, Lemta and Jedala.
While “Lemta” and “Lemtuna” have been regarded in some quarters as
two forms of the same name, the groups are only ethnically
connected, inasmuch as both were Muleththemin. In Leo’s
descriptions of the deserts of Inner Libya the Lemta figure in the
country between Air and the Tibesti mountains; the northern part of
their area is almost identical with the present habitat of the
Azger Tuareg. The Lemtuna, on the other hand, as we shall presently
see, were a subdivision of the Sanhaja who lived much further west.
The passage is a little obscure, but I find it difficult to agree
with the interpretation put upon it by the learned editors of the
Hakluyt Society in their reprint of Leo’s works.</p>

<p>Leo writes:<a id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a> “Having described all the regions of
Numidia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> let us now
proceed with the description of Libya, which is divided into five
parts. . . .”</p>
<p>“The drie and forlorne desert of Zanhaga which bordereth the
westward upon the Ocean Sea and extendeth eastward to the salt pits
of Tegaza”<a id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class=
"fnanchor">[301]</a> is clearly the Atlantic area, now called
Mauretania by the French, between Southern Morocco and the Upper
Niger and Senegal rivers. The Zanhaga are the Sanhaja, a famous
part of the Muleththemin early in their recorded history, but now
fallen into great decay.</p>
<p>The second area appears to be east of the first. The great
steppe and desert area bounded by Southern Morocco and Southern
Algeria in the north, and by the Niger country from Walata<a id=
"FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class=
"fnanchor">[302]</a> to Gao<a id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> in the south, is divided
into two and shared between the Sanhaja in the west, inhabiting his
first area, and the Zanziga or Ganziga in the east, inhabiting his
second area. The latter names are akin to the former and the
people, if not identical, are probably related.</p>
<p>The third area was inhabited by the Targa. It commences from the
desert steppe west of Air and extends eastwards towards the desert
of Igidi.<a id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class=
"fnanchor">[304]</a> Northward it borders on the Tuat, Gourara and
Mzab countries, while in the south it terminates in the wilderness
around Agades and Lower Air. The boundaries of this area are quite
clear: they include the massifs of Air and Ahaggar and the deserts
immediately east and west of the former.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth areas we will come to later.</p>
<p>Leo is obviously attempting to describe the principal
geographical divisions of the Sahara and the Veiled People
inhabiting them. The boundaries of each area are given in terms of
intervening deserts, or of countries inhabited by sedentaries or by
other races which did not wear the Veil.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_333">[333]</span> His divisions, therefore, are not deserts
but habitable steppe or other types of country bounded by deserts,
or non-Tuareg districts.</p>
<p>Some confusion reigns in regard to the third area, the eastern
limit of which is described as the Igidi desert. What is known as
the Igidi desert to-day is a dune area south-west of Beni Abbes in
South Western Algeria; but the position of this Igidi, lying as it
does on the road from Morocco to Timbuctoo, cannot be the
<em>eastern</em> boundary of the third area. This Igidi is, in
fact, in the northern part of the second area, which is that of the
Zanziga. Now this second area is said to contain a desert zone
called “Gogdem,” a name which cannot now be traced in that
neighbourhood, though the well-defined Igidi south-west of Beni
Abbes immediately jumps to the mind as a probable identification.
The eastern boundary of the third area, which includes Air, or, as
Leo calls it, “Hair,” must lie between these mountains and those of
Tibesti. This vast tract is in part true desert, with patches of
white sand dunes, and in part desert steppe with scanty vegetation;
it also contains a few oases. In it is one particular area of white
dune desert crossed by the Chad road and containing a famous well
called Agadem.<a id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305"
class="fnanchor">[305]</a> One of two hypotheses is possible:
either the names “Igidi” and “Gogdem” in the paragraphs<a id=
"FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class=
"fnanchor">[306]</a> dealing with the second and third areas
respectively have become transposed in the text and Gogdem is to be
identified with the Agadem dune desert, or else the whole phrase
relating to the desert of Gogdem has been bodily misplaced at the
end of the section dealing with the Zanziga area, instead of
standing at the end of the succeeding paragraph on the Targa area,
in which case Leo would be calling the Agadem dunes the Gogdem
desert, within or near another Igidi<a id=
"FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class=
"fnanchor">[307]</a> waste. Agadem is quite sufficiently important
as a watering-point on a most difficult section of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> the Chad road to give its name
to the area, nor is it hard to account for the corruption of the
name into Gogdem<a id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308"
class="fnanchor">[308]</a>—such changes have occurred in many
travellers’ notes.<a id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309"
class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The first hypothesis is the most
probable; it affords a simple explanation of an otherwise obscure
passage and renders Leo’s boundaries lucid.</p>
<p>The fourth of Leo’s areas inhabited by the Lemta is described as
extending from the desert east of Air <em>as far as</em> the
country of the Berdeoa. This area seems to be that in which the
Chad road and the wells to the east of it are found. It would
include a part of the desert of Agadem, the Great Steppe north of
Lake Chad, and oases like Jado and the Kawar depression.</p>
<p>The fifth and last area is that <em>of</em> the people of
Berdeoa; it adjoins the Fezzan and Barca in the north, and in the
south the wilderness north of Wadai, including presumably Tibesti
and the Libyan desert west of the Nile Valley. It is said to extend
eastward to the deserts of Aujila, though north-eastward would have
been a more accurate definition.</p>
<p>Between the people of Berdeoa and the Nile Valley are the
Egyptian oases inhabited by the Arabs and some “vile” black
people.</p>
<p>Leo’s description of the Sahara is far from being incorrect or
confused; his information may be summarised as follows:<a id=
"FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class=
"fnanchor">[310]</a></p>
<p class="hang2 space-above15"><em>Areas I and II.</em>—South of
Morocco and Western Algeria; north of the Niger and Senegal rivers;
between the Atlantic littoral and the Ahaggar and Air massifs with
their immediately adjacent deserts or steppes. Inhabitants: Sanhaja
in the west and Zanziga in the east.</p>
<p class="hang2"><em>Area III.</em>—Air and Ahaggar, with their
adjacent areas; south of Tuat, Gourara and Mzab, and north of
Damergu. Inhabitants: Targa.</p>
<p class="hang2"><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_335">[335]</span><em>Area IV.</em>—Desert and steppe between
Air and Tibesti from Wargla and Ghadames in the north to the
country of Kano and Nigeria generally in the south, including the
country of Ghat and the Western Fezzan. Inhabitants: Lemta.</p>
<p class="hang2"><em>Area V.</em>—The Libyan desert of Egypt, the
Cyrenaican steppes and desert, a part of the Eastern Fezzan and
Tibesti, Erdi and Kufra. Inhabitants: the people of Berdeoa with
Arabs in the north-east and some blacks in the south-east.</p>
<p class="space-above15">In the fourth area the Lemta were in the
country where the Azger now live, but the southern and the eastern
sides have since been lost to the Tuareg. Kawar, whence the Tuareg
of Air fetch salt, is under the domination of the latter, but, like
the other habitable areas on the Chad road and in the Great Steppe,
is now inhabited largely by Kanuri and Tebu. There is nothing
improbable in the statement that the Lemta covered the whole of the
fourth area. We have quite other definite and probably independent
records of the Tuareg having lived in the Chad area and in Bornu,
whence they were driven by the Kanuri, who are known to have
conquered Kawar in fairly recent historical times.<a id=
"FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class=
"fnanchor">[311]</a></p>
<p>The people of Berdeoa are the only inhabitants of any of the
five areas who were not Muleththemin. I have little doubt that they
are the inhabitants of Tibesti, where the town or village of Bardai
is perhaps the most important of the permanently inhabited places.
To-day they are Tebu, a name which seems to mean “The People of the
Rock,”<a id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class=
"fnanchor">[312]</a> with an incorrectly formed Arab version,
Tibawi. The racial problem which they present can only be solved
when they are better known. Keane<a id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> assumes that they are
the descendants of the Garamantes, whose primeval home was perhaps
in the Tibesti mountains. He notes the similarity of the names of
their northern branch, the Teda, and a tribe called the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> Tedamansii, who seem, however,
to have lived too far north to be connected with them.<a id=
"FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class=
"fnanchor">[314]</a> The Southern Tebu or Daza section is certainly
more negroid than the northern, and there are reasons for not
accepting the view that the Garamantian civilisation was the
product of a negroid people. Leo<a id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> records the discovery
“of the region of Berdeoa,” which from the context is probably a
misreading for <em>a</em> “region of the Berdeoa” in the Libyan
desert of Egypt. The area is described as containing three castles
and five or six villages. It is probably the Kufra archipelago of
oases. The story of accidental discoveries of oases is also told of
other places; Wau el Harir,<a id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> an oasis in the Eastern
Fezzan, was reported to have been found by accident in 1860, and
the Arab geographers relate similar stories of other points in the
Libyan desert. The accounts of Kufra by Rohlfs and Hassanein Bey go
to show that before it became a centre of the Senussi sect, with
the consequent influx of Cyrenaican Arabs and Libyans, the
population was Tebu. The identity of Berdeoa, which I think must be
Bardai, was the subject of some controversy before circumstantial
accounts of its existence were brought back by travellers in modern
times. The name was for long assumed to be a misreading for Borku
or Borgu, as D’Anville suggested. In Rennell’s map accompanying the
account of Hornemann’s travels at the end of the eighteenth century
the town (<em>sic</em>) of Bornu north of what is presumably meant
to represent Lake Chad is a mislocation for Bornu province, while
Bourgou in Lat. 26° N., Long. 22° E. is intended to represent
Bardai in Tibesti, the Berdeoa of Leo. The “residue of the Libyan
desert”<a id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class=
"fnanchor">[317]</a> (<em>i.e.</em> other than that of the Tebu
people of Berdeoa), namely, Augela (Aujila oasis) to the River of
the Nile, we are told by Leo was inhabited by certaine Arabians and
Africans called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
“Leuata,” a name which coincides with the Lebu or Rebu of Egyptian
records. Idrisi places them in the same area as Leo, calling them
Lebetae or Levata. The stock is referred to under the general name
of Levata or Leuata by Ibn Khaldun in several connections. An
ethnic rather than a tribal name seems to be involved, and this is
natural if they are the descendants of the Lebu. Bates concludes
that in the name of this people is the origin of the classical word
“Libyan.”<a id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class=
"fnanchor">[318]</a> The Leuata<a id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> assisted Hamid ibn
Yesel, Lord of Tehert, in a war in Algeria against El Mansur, the
third Fatimite Khalif. In <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 947-8, when
El Mansur drove Hamid into Spain, the Levata were dispersed into
the desert; some who escaped found refuge in the mountains between
Sfax and Gabes, where they were still living in Ibn Khaldun’s day;
others he places in the Great Syrtis and in the Siwa area. In
Byzantine times they are shown in the Little Syrtis. El Masa’udi
states that the Leuata survived in the Oases of Egypt. Their
principal habitat is, in fact, not far from the country of the
Lebu, who were in Cyrenaica according to Egyptian records. Both the
Tehenu further east and the Lebu are known to have been subjected
to pressure from the Meshwesh in the west, and some fusion between
the two may well, therefore, have occurred. The ancestors of the
Levata of Arab geographers and the modern Libyan inhabitants of
Siwa and the northern oases of the Western Desert of Egypt are
either the product of this fusion or the descendants of the Lebu
alone. The Levata and Lebu seem to have this in common, that they
are probably a non-Tuareg Libyan people immigrant from across the
Mediterranean at the time of the invasions of Egypt by the Libyan
and Sea People. In the course of history they were displaced and
reduced; only in the north-east of the Libyan desert did they
remain at all concentrated or homogeneous.</p>
<p>The Targa who inhabited the third area of Leo
concern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> this volume
most particularly, as their zone includes Air as well as Ahaggar.
So long as the Tuareg were believed to be only a tribe they were
identified with the Targa, but when the former term was discovered
to have a wider or racial significance it was not clear, unless it
was a proper name, why Leo used it of any one section of the
Muleththemin. The exact significance only appears when Ibn
Khaldun’s narrative is considered.</p>
<p>In his History of the Berbers Ibn Khaldun attempted to make a
comprehensive classification of the Libyans. After working out a
comparatively simple system which emphasises both the obvious
diversity as well as the superficial appearance of unity<a id=
"FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class=
"fnanchor">[320]</a> of the population of North Africa, he proceeds
to elaborate more complex schemes of classification which are
difficult to reconcile with one another. He seems throughout to
have derived his information from two or more sources which he was
himself unable to co-ordinate.</p>
<p>Ibn Khaldun divides the Libyans into two families descended from
the eponymous heroes, Branes and Madghis, a theory which recognises
the difficulties involved by the assumption that they all belonged
to a single stock. The division may be traced even to-day. In many
Libyan villages the inhabitants are divided into two factions
which, without being hostile, are conscious of being different. The
factions are not found among the nomadic tribes, where
opportunities for living in separate places are greater than in the
sedentary districts, but their existence among the latter, however,
is hardly otherwise explicable than by the assumption of separate
racial origins. This view is suggested by Ibn Khaldun’s
classification, and also by the result of a detailed examination of
the different constituent elements of the Libyan population. Among
the Tuareg, whom I consider belong to a single stock, different
from that of the various races which composed the other Libyans,
these factions do not exist even in the villages where tribal
organisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> is in
process of breaking down and people of different clans live
together under one headman.</p>
<p>Out of deference to the patriarchal system of the Arabs—a habit
of mind which pervades their life and often distorts their
historical perception—Ibn Khaldun has given to the two Libyan
families of Branes and Madghis a common ancestor called Mazigh.
Both “Madghis” and “Mazigh” are probably derived from the common
MZGh root found to be so widespread in North African names.<a id=
"FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class=
"fnanchor">[321]</a> All three are almost certainly mythical
personages. The selection of Mazigh as the common ancestor points
to an attempt having been made, in accordance with patriarchal
custom, to explain the one characteristic which is really common to
all the Libyans including the Tuareg, namely, their language. While
the MZGh root is not at all universally used as the root of a
national appellation, its occurrence in various parts of North
Africa might well allow one to talk of “Mazigh-speaking People,”
or, as we might more comprehensibly say, “Berber-speaking People.”
And so I would confine the use of both “Berber” and “Mazigh” to a
linguistic signification, analogous to that of the word “Aryan,”
which simply denotes people, not necessarily of the same racial
stock, speaking one of the Aryan group of languages.<a id=
"FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class=
"fnanchor">[322]</a></p>
<p>Ibn Khaldun places the home of most of the divisions of the
Beranes and Madghis Libyans in Syria. They were, he says, the sons
of Mazigh, the son of Canaan, the son of Ham, and consequently
related to the Philistines and Gergesenes, who did not leave the
east when their kinsmen came to Africa. All Moslems possess a form
of snobbishness which is displayed in their attempt to establish
some connection, direct or indirect, with an Arabian tribe related
to the people of the Prophet Muhammad. In Morocco this feeling is
so strong that it is common to find Libyan families free from all
admixture with the Arab invaders, boasting ancestral trees
descended from the Prophet. The Maghreb is full of pseudo-Ashraf; a
term in the Moslem world which is properly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_340">[340]</span> reserved for the descendants of the Leader
of Islam. The same occurs in Central Africa. Much of the legendary
history of the Libyans relating to an eastern home may therefore be
discounted as attempts on the part of Moslem historians to connect
them with the lands and race of Islam. Nevertheless, even when all
allowances have been made for this factor there remains to be
explained a strong tradition of some connection between North
Africa and the Arab countries. Not only is it commented upon in all
the early histories, but it is to some extent still current to-day
among the people. I am not convinced that it cannot be explained by
the presence among the Libyans of one element which certainly did
come from the East in the period preceding and during the invasions
of Egypt, when the people of the Eastern Mediterranean co-operated
with the Africans in their attacks on the Nile Valley. The
undoubted occurrence of migrations within the historical period
both from Syria and from the east coast of the Red Sea are alone
sufficient, if the characteristic of Moslem snobbishness is taken
into account, to account for such traditions regarding their home.
It is unnecessary to attribute these stories to the original
appearance of the Libyans proper in Africa even if their cradle is
to be looked for in the East. This may be inherently probable, but
must be placed at so remote a date as to ensure that traditions
connected therewith were certainly by now forgotten.</p>
<p>Ibn Khaldun divides the families of Branes and Madghis
respectively into ten and four divisions. Four of the ten Beranes
people, the Lemta, Sanhaja, Ketama and Auriga, are called the
Muleththemin, or People of the Veil.<a id=
"FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class=
"fnanchor">[323]</a> The descendants of Madghis, with whom we are
not concerned, include the Louata or Levata. The hypothesis
previously brought forward for their non-Tuareg origin gains
support from the fact that in Ibn Khaldun’s classification they are
not placed in the same family as the People of the Veil.</p>
<p>We now come to Ibn Khaldun’s views regarding the origin of the
Muleththemin. The four divisions of Lemta, Sanhaja,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span> Ketama and Auriga, though in
the Beranes group, he regarded as of a different origin to the
other six sections. The inconsistency of the patriarchal
classification is apparent. He states that certain traditions which
he is inclined to accept as true connect the Sanhaja and the Ketama
with the Yemen.<a id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324"
class="fnanchor">[324]</a> They were Himyarite tribes which came
from the east coast of the Red Sea to Africa under the leadership
of Ifrikos, the hero who gave his name to Ifrikiya, which is now
called Tunisia. In examining the organisation and history of the
Aulimmiden Tuareg who live between the Air mountains and the Niger
bend, Barth<a id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class=
"fnanchor">[325]</a> found that they also claimed to be descended
from Himyer. Now the Aulimmiden in name and history are a part of
the Lemta who migrated from the area in North Africa where the rest
of the section still lives under the name of Azger, and where we
are first able to identify them from our records. What is true in
this respect of a part is true of the whole, and three out of the
four divisions of the Muleththemin thus seem to be racially
different from the other six Beranes divisions, the fourth section
in question being the Auriga people, who are also called Hawara.
The latter present one of the most difficult problems in the early
history of North Africa. Suffice it here to state that in the
course of the early Arab invasions many of them lost so much of
their individuality that we must rely largely on Ibn Khaldun’s
classification of them among the four divisions of the Tuareg for
their early identity.</p>
<p>There are then, according to Ibn Khaldun, two separate families
of Libyans, and in one of these is a group apparently different
racially from the remainder of the two families.</p>
<div class="figcenter iw13">
<figure id="map08"><a href="images/map08.jpg"><img src=
'images/map08.jpg' alt='[Illustration]'></a></figure>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>It is a
complicated classification which attempts to establish some sort of
unity among all the Libyans, and at the same time indicates without
room for doubt that the learned historian felt he was dealing with
a mixed population. His difficulties are clear. His statements
support the view that the Tuareg are separate from the rest of the
people called Libyans, who are themselves composed of at least two
stocks, though more than this regarding the origin of the Tuareg I
should not yet feel entitled to deduce from his account.</p>
<p>At a later stage, when the origins of the People of Air come to
be examined, another reference will be found, in the writings of an
authority in the Sudan, to the migration of a people from the east
coast of the Red Sea into Africa. This Himyaritic invasion is so
much insisted upon in various works that the presumption of a
migration from that direction, with which the Tuareg were
associated, is tempting, though it is not clear whether the
Sudanese authority was merely copying Ibn Khaldun’s statements or
whether he was working on independent information. I have mentioned
the theory because it is one of the more usually accepted
explanations of the origin of the Tuareg, but I do not think the
problem can be so easily resolved. My own view is that the Tuareg
are not Himyarites, but that the memory of an invasion from that
quarter which undoubtedly did contribute to the population of
Central Africa was adopted by their own traditional historians and
accepted by Ibn Khaldun to establish a connection for the People of
the Veil with the land of the Prophet. The migrations across the
Red Sea are far more likely to have accounted for the early Semitic
influence in Africa, especially in the Nilotic Sudan before the
rise of Islam, and in Abyssinia, than for the origin of the Tuareg,
who, I am convinced, were already in the continent at a far earlier
date.</p>
<p>Ibn Khaldun now introduces a further classification which again
emphasises the separateness or individuality of the Tuareg. He
states that among the Beranes were certain divisions collectively
known as the Children of Tiski. Among<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_343">[343]</span> these were the Hawara, Heskura, Sanhaja,
Lemta, and Gezula. The Hawara we know were the same as the Auriga;
the Sanhaja and Lemta have already been mentioned. The Heskura and
Gezula may therefore be subdivisions of the Ketama, and the
Children of Tiski, therefore, probably a collective term for all
the Muleththemin as a whole.</p>
<p>Ibn Khaldun’s writings are voluminous and have a baffling
tendency to jump about from subject to subject. Having given us
these explanations, which though complicated are comprehensible, he
suddenly brings in a host of new names, and proceeds to inform us
that the Muleththemin are descended from the “Sanhaja of the second
race” and to consist of the Jedala or Gedala, Lemtuna, Utzila,
Targa, Zegawa and Lemta divisions. It is not within the scope of
this work to examine all the Tuareg groups in Africa in detail. To
investigate the Zanziga of Leo’s second area or the Utzila or
Jedala of Ibn Khaldun would only serve to complicate the issue
which deals with the Tuareg of Air. But the Sanhaja, although they
lived in the furthest west of the Sahara, played such an important
part in the history of all the Tuareg that they must be briefly
mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>At one period nearly all the People of the Veil were united in a
sort of desert confederation under the dominion of the Sanhaja. The
era terminated with the death of Ibn Ghania in about <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 1233, some 150 years before Ibn Khaldun wrote,
even by which time, however, the inner parts of Africa had hardly
recovered. The memory of the Sanhaja empire, which extended from
the Senegal River to Fez and eastwards perhaps as far as Tibesti,
survived in the additional classifications of Ibn Khaldun and in
the stories about the Tuareg collected by his contemporaries. It is
possible to suppose that the first ethnological systems he gives
refer to the state of the Muleththemin before or during the Sanhaja
confederacy, but that when he gives the list of names of six
divisions descended from the “second race of Sanhaja” he is
referring to the People of the Veil after the death of Ibn Ghania.
At that time the name of the dominant group in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_344">[344]</span> the confederation had been given by the
other inhabitants of North Africa generally to all the Tuareg. In
the process of disintegration of the empire several truly Sanhaja
tribes were absorbed by other Tuareg groups. It is difficult to
accept the alternative view that the Sanhaja of the second race are
a different people from the earlier Sanhaja, for such a conclusion
would imply that the Muleththemin were made up of more than one
racial stock, whereas their most obvious characteristic is unity of
type and habit.</p>
<p>The Sanhaja division of Ibn Khaldun’s first grouping are
obviously the same as the people of Leo’s first area on the western
side of the great desert which extends between Beni Abbes and
Timbuctoo. After their period of fame they came on evil days, and
were reduced to the position of tributaries when they lost many of
their Tuareg characteristics. Their remnants are the Mesufa and
Lemtuna tribes. The relationship of the Sanhaja and Lemta noted by
Barth either means nothing more than that they were both
Muleththemin, or dates from their association with each other
during the Sanhaja empire; for they were ever separate ethnic
divisions of the People of the Veil.</p>
<p>Much trouble has been occasioned by the confusion of the names
Lemta and Lemtuna. The apparent derivation of the latter from the
former may also have been due to the association of the two main
divisions: it is important only to emphasise that while the one is
a subdivision of the Sanhaja now living in the north-west corner of
the Sahara near Morocco, the other is a branch of the Tuareg race
co-equal with the latter. It is in this confusion of names that the
explanation is to be found of the statement so often heard and
repeated by Barth, that the Lemta were the neighbours of the
Moorish Walad Delim of Southern Morocco. The position of the
Lemtuna makes this statement true of them, but not of the Lemta,
whose home, both on the authority of Leo and on other evidence, was
far removed from Mauretania, and, to wit, in the Fezzan. The
erroneous association of the Lemta with the Walad Delim is largely
responsible for the wrong account of the migrations of various
sections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span> of the
southern and south-eastern Tuareg given by Barth and his
successors.<a id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class=
"fnanchor">[326]</a></p>
<p>But let us return to the people who were the ancestors of the
Air Tuareg. The Hawara, according to Ibn Khaldun, El Bekri and El
Masa’udi, inhabited Tripolitania, the deserts of Ifrikiya, and even
parts of Barca. They lived, in part at least, side by side with the
Lemta, Wearers of the Veil, who were “near,” or “as far as”
Gawgawa. It has been assumed that this Gawgawa was the Kaukau of
Ibn Batutah’s travels, and consequently Gao or Gaogao or Gogo or
Gagho on the Niger. But it is more reasonably identified with Kuka
on Lake Chad, and if this is so, the Lemta according to Ibn Khaldun
extended precisely as far as the place referred to by Leo, in
speaking of his fourth area.<a id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> It is clear that Ibn
Khaldun meant “as far as” and not “near,” for in referring to the
Hawarid origin of a part of the Lemta people he says that they may
be so recognised “by their name, which is an altered form of the
word Hawara: for having changed the و (<em>w</em>) into a sort of
<em>k</em> which is intermediary between the soft <em>g</em> and
the hard <em>q</em>, they have formed “Haggar.” The latter are, of
course, the Ahaggaren, who then, as now, lived in mountains called
by the same name a very long way from Kuka on Lake Chad; even so
they were coterminous with the Lemta, a point which coincides with
the evidence of Leo and others. Further indications of the
extension of the Lemta as far as Lake Chad will be dealt with in
the next chapter; they are confirmed both by the sequence of events
in Air and by the occupation of Tademekka by the Aulimmiden-Lemta,
culminating in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1640 when the former
inhabitants of that area were driven towards the west.<a id=
"FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class=
"fnanchor">[328]</a> All this would be incomprehensible if Gawgawa
were identified with Gao on the Niger, or if Ibn Khaldun’s “near”
were not interpreted as “towards” or “as far as.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>It may appear
strange to find Ibn Khaldun referring to the Hawarid origin of the
Lemta when they are repeatedly given elsewhere by him as separate
and co-equal divisions of the Muleththemin. It is possible that
originally “Hawara” or “Auriga” may have been the national name of
all the Tuareg, and that on the analogy of what we know happens in
the case of tribes which have split up, one group may have retained
the name of the parent stock. But if this ever did take place it
must have happened long before the Moslem invasion, by which time
the Tuareg had already become established in the divisions which we
know; such an occurrence would have no practical bearing on
conditions prevailing to-day. It is therefore easier to assume that
all he meant to convey was the existence of a certain rather close
connection between the Hawara and Lemta. We know in fact that,
though not identical, the two groups have interchanged tribes, some
of each division being found in the other one. This connection
would account for the suspicious etymology of the word “Haggar,”
which sounds uncommonly like an attempt on his part to prove
philologically what is known traditionally to be the case.</p>
<p>The Hawara as we know them to-day are not all Tuareg or even
Libyans, although they were included among the Beranes families
under the name of Auriga, and were specifically numbered among the
People of the Veil. They were described as an element of great
importance among the pre-Arab Libyans and reckoned co-equal with
the Sanhaja. Ibn Khaldun does, however, add that at the time of the
Arab conquest of North Africa they had assimilated a number of
other tribes of different stock, which probably explains the rapid
“Arabisation” of a part of them. It was the non-Tuareg part which
became readily proselytised and so passed under the influence of
the new rulers of North Africa. The Hawara were much to the fore in
the occupation of Spain and generally in the Arab doings of the
Fatimite era. Some of them in common with other Libyans supported
the Kharejite schism in Islam; yet another part which
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span> become
“Arabised” established itself under the name of the Beni Khattab in
the Fezzan, with their capital at Zuila. But those of them who most
retained their Tuareg characteristics represent the original stock.
In referring to certain Libyans by the name of Hawara, Ibn Khaldun
is obviously not speaking of Tuareg people; one may therefore
conclude that he means the strangers whom they assimilated.<a id=
"FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class=
"fnanchor">[329]</a> Consequently I prefer to use the name “Hawara”
for the whole group, but when the section which preserves its
Tuareg characteristics is indicated the name “Auriga” is more
applicable.</p>
<p>It may be conceived that a people of such importance left some
trace of their name among the Tuareg of to-day, in addition to the
name “Haggar,” where Ibn Khaldun’s etymology seems suspicious. The
name can be recognised in the form “Oraghen” or “Auraghen,” or in
an older spelling “Iuraghen,” a tribe in the Azger group. The root
also occurs in the name “Auraghiye” given to the Air dialect of the
Tuareg language. These instances are valuable evidence.</p>
<p>Duveyrier<a id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class=
"fnanchor">[330]</a> records of the Oraghen tribe that “according
to tradition they originally came from the neighbourhood of
Sokna.<a id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class=
"fnanchor">[331]</a> Before establishing themselves where they are
now located, the tribe inhabited in succession the Fezzan, the
country of Ghat, and Ahawagh, a territory situate on the left bank
of the Niger, east of Timbuctoo. It was in this locality that the
tribe divided; one part, the one under review, returned to the
environs of Ghat, the other more numerous part remained in the
Ahawagh. . . .” The Ahawagh or Azawagh is some way east of
Timbuctoo, it is, in point of fact, as Barth rightly points out,
the area south of Air. He says:<a id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> “Their original abode
was said to be at a place called Asawa (Azawagh)<a id=
"FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class=
"fnanchor">[333]</a> to the south of Iralghawen
(Eghalgawen)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> in
Southern Air.” While the exact sequence of movements thus recorded
may not be accurate, the indications are of importance in
considering the origin of the people of Air as they refer to a
southward migration through Air and a partial return north. But
whereas in the Azger country the Auraghen are a noble tribe, in the
Southland they are a servile tribe of the Aulimmiden.<a id=
"FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class=
"fnanchor">[334]</a> This fact is very significant and seems to
provide an explanation of the ancestry of the Tademekkat and of
some of the People of Air,<a id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> who are in part of
Hawarid origin. The date of the expulsion of the Tademekkat people
towards the west and north by the Aulimmiden prior and up to about
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1640 coincides with the legend
recorded by Duveyrier of a party of southern Auraghen who came to
the assistance of their cousins among the Azger and helped to break
the domination of the Imanen kings of the Azger. Those Auraghen who
remained behind in the Tademekka country were eventually reduced to
a state of vassalage and pushed westward during the general
movement which took place in that direction.</p>
<p>But in spite of the occurrence of a tribe with this name among
the Azger, it is not the latter group but the Ahaggaren who were
originally Auriga, even as the Azger were in essence Lemta,
notwithstanding the considerable exchange of tribes which has taken
place between the two groups.</p>
<p>In another place I have had occasion to doubt whether the
usually accepted derivation of the word “Tuareg” applied, as it now
is, to all the People of the Veil was entirely satisfactory. The
derivation seemed founded on the fallacy of “post hoc, ergo propter
hoc.” The name Targa in Leo and Ibn Khaldun appears to be the same
word as Tuareg, in a slightly modified form; but in these authors
it is not used of all but only of a part of the Muleththemin. It is
a proper name like Sanhaja, or Lemta, and the group
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> bears it is
as important as the other main divisions. Now in one place Leo
names the divisions of the Muleththemin as the Sanhaja, Zanziga,
Targa, Lemta and Jadala; in another as the Sanhaja, Targa, Jedala,
Lemta and Lemtuna, of which we can eliminate the last named as a
subdivision of the Sanhaja. Elsewhere again he calls them the
Sanhaja, Zanziga, Guenziga, Targa and Lemta. Further, in Ibn
Khaldun we learn that the Sanhaja, Hawara, Lemta, Gezula and
Heskura are in one group as the Children of Tiski, and again he
divides the race into four divisions only, the Sanhaja, Auriga,
Ketama and Lemta. Of these we can eliminate the Lemtuna as a part
of the Sanhaja. Leo’s Zanziga and Guenziga are modifications of the
latter name and were given to the Tuareg immediately east of them,
probably during their desert confederation; Ibn Khaldun’s Heskura
and Gezula seem to be two names for one division which possibly was
the Ketama. Now if the remaining names are considered, it is
noteworthy that in no one of the lists do the two names Targa and
Hawara or Auriga occur. They are therefore quite likely to be
different names for the same group. Furthermore, in Leo’s third
area the veiled inhabitants of the Air and Ahaggar mountains are
both called Targa, and the latter and a large part of the former
are known to be Hawara. The conclusion is that “Targa,” so far from
being merely a descriptive or abusive term, is another name for
Hawara-Auriga. The fact that the dialect spoken in Air is called
Auraghiye alone would justify Leo classifying the inhabitants both
of Air as well as of Ahaggar under one term, namely, Targa, if, as
is highly probable, the name is an alternative for Auriga or
Hawara, or for at least a large part of them.</p>
<p>Having suggested this equivalent we must return to the question,
already foreshadowed, namely, whether, from an examination of the
present tribes of the Ahaggaren and Azger groups of Tuareg, any
conclusion can be drawn showing that at one and the same time a
connection between the two divisions and a separate ancestry
existed. It is necessary to postulate for the moment, as has
already been done, that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_350">[350]</span> the Azger were the old Lemta, for the
evidence can only be considered in detail a little later. It might
have seemed more rational to deal with it now, especially as their
history is of greater importance to Air than that of the Ahaggaren,
but for various reasons which will become apparent it will be found
more convenient to examine the latter first.</p>
<p>In Air and in the south generally the two divisions are referred
to collectively by the name of Ahaggaren. The reason is that the
Azger are now so reduced in numbers that the world has tended to
forget their name for that of their more powerful and prosperous
western neighbours; the Ahaggaren on account of their trading and
caravan traffic have also come more into contact with the outside
world. The Azger, on the other hand, instead of becoming better
known, as a result of the French penetration of the Sahara have
migrated eastwards further and further away from Europeans into the
recondite places of the Fezzan mountains, which they now only leave
to raid Air or Kawar in company with rascals like the northern Tebu
and the more irreconcilable Ahaggaren, who have refused to submit
to French administration. Although in Air “Ahaggaren” has come to
mean just Northern Tuareg, it has no strict ethnic
signification.</p>
<p>Many travellers in the Ahaggar country have heard the tradition
current among the population that the Ahaggaren are considered
originally to have formed part of the Azger division.
Duveyrier<a id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class=
"fnanchor">[336]</a> records that the Ahaggaren and cognate Tuareg
to the north-west are divided into fourteen principal noble
tribes:</p>
<ul class="simple1">
<li>Tegehe<a id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class=
"fnanchor">[337]</a> Mellen,</li>
<li>Tegehe n’es Sidi,</li>
<li>En Nitra,</li>
<li>Taitoq,</li>
<li>Tegehe n’Aggali,<a id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></li>
<li>Inemba Kel Emoghi,</li>
<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>Inemba Kel

<li>Ibogelan,</li>
<li>Tegehe n’Essakkal,</li>
<li>Ikadeen,</li>
<li>Ikerremoïn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bissuel,<a id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class=
"fnanchor">[340]</a> however, declares that the Taitoq, Tegehe n’es
Sidi and Ireshshumen form a separate group of people living in the
Adrar Ahnet, who are sometimes called collectively the Taitoq, but
should more correctly be described as the Ar’rerf Ahnet. The noble
tribes of this confederation, the Taitoq proper and the Tegehe n’es
Sidi, claim to be of independent origin and not related either to
the Ahaggaren or the Azger. The Ireshshumen are said to be a mixed
tribe composed of the descendants of Taitoq men, and women of their
Imghad, the Kel Ahnet. There are also four Imghad tribes: the Kel
Ahnet and Ikerremoin, who depend from the Taitoq, and the Tegehe
n’Efis (probably n’Afis) and the Issokenaten, who depend from the
Tegehe n’es Sidi. These Imghad live in Ahnet, but in 1888 were as
far afield as the Talak plain west of Air.<a id=
"FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class=
"fnanchor">[341]</a> The Ikerremoin of the Ahnet mountains—though
probably of the same stock as the noble tribe of the same name in
Ahaggar—are a distinct unit; they were probably a part of the
latter until conquered in war by the Taitoq. The Tuareg nobles of
Ahnet may be considered a separate branch of the race, possibly
descended from the Ketama. They are neither Auriga nor Lemta and
probably not Sanhaja either. The Taitoq tribes must therefore be
omitted from Duveyrier’s record.</p>
<p>He states that a split occurred between the Azger and Ahaggaren.
About fifty years before he was writing, or,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_352">[352]</span> in other words, about a century ago, the
Kel Ahamellen, like other Tuareg tribes in the area, were under the
rule of the Imanen kings of Azger. The latter rulers are described
as of the same stock as the Auraghen and as “strangers” among the
Azger. Such a description is logical if they were, as we may
suppose, an Auriga stock living among the Lemta or Azger. The Kel
Ahamellen were settled on the extreme west of the country held by
the latter division, and according to the story became so numerous
that they divided up into the sub-tribes whose names occur in this
list, and so broke away from the allegiance of the Imanen kings.
But if in Duveyrier’s day the Kel Ahamellen had only broken away
from the Azger confederation as recently as fifty years previously,
and were, as he also says, in a state of internal anarchy, it is
out of the question for one clan to have increased sufficiently
rapidly to form fourteen large noble sub-tribes covering an area
reaching from Ghat to the Ahnet massif. The supposition is that the
Kel Ahamellen did in fact break away from the Azger about then, for
tradition is strong on this point, but that instead of being alone
to form the new division they joined a group of other tribes
already in existence, namely, the descendants of the original
Auriga-Ahaggaren stock. It is immaterial whether the latter were
also under the domination of the Azger Imanen kings a century or so
before, though it may be remembered that this reigning clan was
itself from Ahaggar.</p>

<p class="space-above15">Kel Ahamellen, or the “White People,” is a
descriptive and not a proper name, a circumstance which points to
the view that such was not their original appellation. In the
course of time the unit became divided into three tribes, the Kel
Ahamellen proper, the Tegehe Aggali (dag Rali) and the Tegehe
n’Esakkal. The “I name” of the original stock was lost, and so the
group collectively bore the same label as the smaller Kel Ahamellen
tribe. By the beginning of this century, when the French advance
took place, the Ahaggaren were already organised under their own
king Ahitagel. When their country was finally occupied,
Musa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> Ag Mastan was
reigning over them and contributed largely to the pacification. He
continued as Amenokal of Ahaggar until his death in December 1916.
Of the fourteen Ahaggar tribes, therefore, the three Kel Ahamellen
are closely related to each other, and appear to constitute the
Azger nucleus among them. There may, of course, be other Azger
among the remaining eleven Ahaggaren tribes who are the Auriga
element, but no other information seems at the moment available.
The traditional connection of these two Tuareg divisions is so
strongly associated with the three Kel Ahamellen that it is they
who must be regarded as the most recent and perhaps as the primary
or principal offshoot of the Azger among the Ahaggar people.</p>
<p>The presence of the Kel Ahamellen in the west would account for
the traditional common origin of the Ahaggaren and Azger. The
warlike qualities of the latter would inevitably tempt a vain
people even though of different stock to associate themselves with
so famous a division. The fact that both Ahaggar and the Azger were
at one time under the domination of the Azger Imanen kings would,
moreover, have the same effect. That some explanation of the sort
which I have given is correct seems to be clear from the two
different forms in which the traditional connection is recorded.
Ibn Khaldun postulated the Hawarid origin of the Lemta, and adduced
as proof the etymology of the name “Haggar.” Duveyrier, on the
other hand, declared that his researches led him to believe that
the Ahaggaren were originally Azger.<a id=
"FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class=
"fnanchor">[342]</a></p>
<p>The Azger, whom all are agreed to-day in regarding as a distinct
group of Tuareg for all that they are connected with the Ahaggaren
and the people of Air, range over the country between the eastern
slopes of the Ahaggar mountains and Murzuk in the Fezzan. Whereas
the Ahaggaren control the caravan roads between Algeria or Tuat and
Ahaggar, and share with the Tuareg of Air the western tracks
between their respective mountains, the Azger consider the
roads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> from Ghat to
the north and to the east as their own property. They share with
the people of Air the main caravan track by way of Asiu or In Azawa
to the latter country.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to say much of the present state of the
Azger. Their movement away from contact with Europeans and their
intractable characteristics have kept them from becoming known.
This is all the more regrettable, since, owing to their association
with the Fezzan, a knowledge of their history and peculiarities
might throw light on the puzzling problem of the Garamantian and
Tuareg civilisations. They seem also, in spite of their very
reduced numbers, to be the purest of all the Tuareg.
Duveyrier’s<a id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class=
"fnanchor">[343]</a> account of them is the best one which exists.
They have always enjoyed a most remarkable reputation for courage
and even foolhardiness. It is said that it takes two Azger to raid
a village out of which twenty Ahaggaren would be chased.</p>
<p>The Azger count six noble tribes, the Imanen, Auraghen,
Imettrilalen, Kel Ishaban, Ihadanaren, Imanghassaten. The
last-named tribe is of Arab origin descended from a Bedawi stock of
the Wadi el Shati in the Fezzan. Its members are the fighting
troops of the Imanen and have come to be regarded as Noble Tuareg.
Though the People of the Veil recognise nobility or servility of
other races, I know of no other instance where a foreign stock has
achieved complete recognition among these people as Imajegh or
Noble. In all other cases foreign stocks, even of noble caste
according to the standards of the Tuareg, technically become
servile when conquered or absorbed. In the case of the
Imanghassaten, their assimilation to the nobility must have been
due to the fact that they lived side by side with the Azger and
were never conquered by them. In other instances of Arabs
associated with Tuareg the racial distinction remains clear and is
recognised. Among the Taitoq of Ahnet the Arab Mazil and Sokakna
tribes supply the camels for the caravans crossing the desert to
Timbuctoo, where the Arab Meshagra, who dress like the Tuareg, used
to be associated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
with the veiled Kunta tribe until they were evicted by the Igdalen
Tuareg from their homes and took refuge with the Aulimmiden.<a id=
"FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class=
"fnanchor">[344]</a> But though associated with them, none of these
three Arab tribes have ever been counted as Tuareg nobles.</p>
<p>Parallel to the Azger Kel Ahamellen among the Ahaggaren are the
Auraghen and Imanen in the Azger group, for they belong to the
Auriga family. Other Azger tribes may also have been Auriga, but
there are no records on the subject.</p>
<p>Nearly all the Azger tribes have dependent servile tribes in
addition to slaves, but there are two classes in the confederation
described as neither noble nor servile but mixed in caste. These
are the Kel T’inalkum<a id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> (the Tinylkum of Barth)
and the Ilemtin tribes, and two tribes of Inisilman or Holy Men,
the Ifoghas and the Ihehawen. These are accorded the privileges of
nobles.<a id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class=
"fnanchor">[346]</a></p>
<p>The name of the “Ilemtin” is interesting. It is another form of
“Aulimmiden,” the Tuareg who live in the steppe west of Air, and
is, of course, identical with “Lemta.” Moreover, the Ilemtin are in
the very area where Leo had placed the northern part of the Lemta
division. With their kindred the Kel T’inalkum, who also are
neither noble nor servile, and perhaps with the Ihehawen, they
represent the old parent stock of the Azger-Lemta. Their very
antiquity, together with their tradition of nobility among the
other tribes in the confederation, may be held to account by
progressive deterioration for their curious caste. The Ifoghas and
the Kel Ishaban are said to have been of the Kel el Suk or
Tademekkat Tuareg: in the case of the former, at least, I do not
think that this is so. They are a very widespread tribe in the
Sahara, but indications will be given later showing that they too
are probably Lemta. Their association<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_356">[356]</span> with Tademekka is doubtless due to a part
of them being found in a region to which they presumably migrated
when the other Lemta people invaded Air from the south-east and
also formed the Aulimmiden group.<a id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>
<p>In late classical times the northern part of the Lemta area of
Leo was occupied by the Garamantian kingdom and by the nomadic
Ausuriani, Mazices and Ifuraces.<a id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The Ausuriani and
Mazices were people of considerable importance and behaved like
true Tuareg, raiding in company with one another into Cyrenaica and
Egypt. The Maxyes, Mazices, etc., people with names of the MZGh
root, seem to be the Meshwesh of Egyptian records. They are
probably some of the ancestors of the Tuareg, and may be assumed to
have been related to the Ausuriani, with whom they were always
associated. The latter, who are also called Austuriani, are
described by Synesius as one of the native people of Libya, in
contrast with other Libyans whom he knew to have arrived at a later
date.<a id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class=
"fnanchor">[349]</a> Bates<a id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> thinks that the
Ausuriani may be the Arzuges of Orosius. Now the form of the name
Arzuges, and more remotely that of Ausuriani or Austuriani, points
to an identification with the Azger. But that is not all. The
position of the Ausuriani in late classical times agrees well with
that given by Ammianus for the home of the Astacures, who are also
mentioned by Ptolemy.<a id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> This name is
intermediate between “Ausuriani” and “Arzuges,” and again is
similar to “Azger.” Duveyrier<a id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> has come to the
independent conclusion that these people under various but similar
names must be identified with the Azger, who therefore for the last
fourteen centuries appear to have occupied the same area in part
that they do now. Their northern limit, it is true, has been driven
south as a result of the Arab and other invasions of the
Mediterranean littoral, and their southern territory has been lost
to them, but in the main their zone has hardly changed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>One may,
however, adduce further evidence. Among the Lemta-Azger are the
Ifoghas, a tribe of Holy Men. There is little doubt that these
people are the Ifuraces of Corippus and others, whose position east
of the Ausuriani is only a little north of where their descendants
still live.<a id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class=
"fnanchor">[353]</a> Incidentally both the area in which they live
and the area in which they were reported in classical times may be
held to be well within the boundaries of Leo’s Lemta zone. Last of
all, there arises the question of the Ilaguantan or Laguatan of
Corippus, who are not, I think, to be identified with the Levata or
Louata, but are the people who gave the name to the country now
called Elakkos, or Alagwas, or Elakwas, to the east of Damergu and
south-east of Air, at the southern end of the Lemta area of Leo. In
view of the course taken by the migration of the Lemta southwards
there is nothing inherently improbable in the people, who in late
classical times appear in the north, having migrated to a new
habitat near the Sudan.</p>
<p>The migration of the Lemta is intimately connected with the
history of the Tuareg of Air, and accounts for the position of the
Aulimmiden west of the latter country. In commenting on the
organisation of the south-western division of the Tuareg,
Barth<a id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class=
"fnanchor">[354]</a> says that the whole group is designated by the
name of Awelimmid, Welimmid or Aulimmiden (as they are known in
Air), from the dominating tribe whose supremacy is recognised in
some form or other by the remainder, “and in that respect even (the
Tademmekat or) Tademekkat are included among the Aulimmiden;<a id=
"FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class=
"fnanchor">[355]</a> but the real stock of Aulimmiden is very
small.” He goes on to make the statement, which is obviously
correct, and which my deductions absolutely confirm, that “the
original group of the Aulimmiden (Ulmdn is the way the name is
expressed in T’ifinagh) are identical with the Lemta,” the
name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span> probably
signifying literally “the Children of Lemta, or rather ‘Limmid,’ or
the name may originally have been an adjective.” As already stated,
I do not agree with him that the Lemta, who became the Aulimmiden,
descended from the Igidi in the north and drove out the Tademekkat,
for I believe that the people in the north were the Lemtuna, living
near the Walad Delim or Morocco, and that they were therefore a
Sanhaja and not a Lemta tribe. If the Lemta had been in the area
where Barth would have them, as opposed to where Leo placed them,
it means that the latter’s account is fundamentally wrong. Nor
would there be any adequate explanation of several phenomena just
now indicated such as the westward movements of the Tademekkat and
the presence of the Ilemtin in the Azger country.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of the Lemta and Auriga in the history of Air
may be summarised as follows:—The Azger represent the old Lemta
stock in the northern part of the area which Leo allocated to them.
They are identical with the Ausuriani, Asturiani, Arzuges or
Astacuri, and included the Ifoghas (Ifuraces) and Elakkos people
(Ilaguantan). The Mazices are probably also in the same Lemta-Azger
group, but I can find only circumstantial evidence for this
supposition. The southern end of the Lemta area, which reached the
Sudan between Lake Chad and Damergu, was lost to the Tuareg under
pressure from the east. They were driven out of Bornu, where we
shall see the Central African histories placed them in the early
days. This part, as well as the Kawar road down which they came
from the north, and the steppe north of Chad, was cleared of Tuareg
by the Kanuri and Tebu from the east. In Elakkos, the country named
by the tribe which in classical times was in Tripolitania, is the
boundary to-day between Tebu and Tuareg. Progressive ethnic
pressure from the east drove the eastern boundary of the Tuareg
westwards, but it also forced the Lemta to find room in the west
for their expansion. Some of the latter, as we shall see, entered
Air from the south; others went on to occupy Tademekka and drove
the inhabitants westward.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_359">[359]</span> The Lemta movement was of long duration and
directly involved the first invasion of Air by the Tuareg: it took
place south and then west, not, as Barth and others would have it,
south-eastwards from North-west Africa. Before these movements took
place Ahaggar was held by a Hawara stock which later received an
admixture of Azger by the Kel Ahamellen who had split off from the
latter. Air, which had first been occupied by a group of Lemta from
the south-east, was then invaded by another wave of Tuareg from the
north. They were almost certainly a Hawarid stock. By the time Leo
wrote Air was therefore in a large measure occupied by the same
race and group as Ahaggar, and like the latter was therefore
rightly described as held by the “Targa popolo.”</p>

<p class="sch">THE HISTORY OF AIR</p>
<p class="sch2">Part I</p>
<p class="sch3">The Migrations of the Tuareg to Air</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> history of Air is inextricably mixed
up with the problems of Tuareg ethnology. It is best to treat the
various questions which arise as a whole. Information for all the
earlier events is scanty. As has already become apparent in
previous chapters, much must be based on deduction, since no early
written evidence of the Air people exists but that contained in
their rock inscriptions. In later years the practice arose of
keeping book records or tribal histories in Arabic; they were
designed to establish the nobility of origin of the various clans,
a subject of continual dispute among the Tuareg; but most of these
precious books, which used to be kept in the mosques or houses of
the learned men, were lost when the whole of Air north of the
Central massifs was cleared by French Camel patrols after the 1917
rebellion.</p>
<p>For long the avowed policy of the French authorities was to
remove the population of the mountains of Air lock, stock and
barrel, and settle them in the lands of Damergu and the Sudan. The
Tuareg, as may be imagined, took unkindly to living in the plains
away from the mountains and desert to which they were used. They
cannot be persuaded to settle on the land as agriculturists except
after generations of contact with tillers of the soil, and even
then they only adopt the new mode of life in a half-hearted fashion
or as a result of intermarriage, and as a consequence<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span> lose their individuality.
Besides embittering relations to an extent which may prove
irremediable, the French policy was otherwise disastrous from a
local point of view. After being driven out of their homes in the
mountains, these people were not content to live in the half-way
house of the Damergu plains or in Damagarim. Many of them moved out
of French territory altogether into Nigeria, where they had no
quarrel with the authorities and where existence was even easier
than in the belt between the Sahara and the Sudan. As many as
30,000 Veiled People left Air; most of them settled in the Emirates
of Kano and Katsina.</p>
<p>Depopulation in Air allowed the desert to encroach. Wells fell
in, gardens went out of tillage, and the live-stock of the country,
more especially the camel herds, were reduced to a fraction of what
they had been. These factors in turn contributed to make it harder
than ever to reopen the old caravan roads, after they had been
closed during the Great War. From the economic standpoint the
possibility of obtaining any return from the military occupation of
this part of the Sahara became more than ever problematical.
Finally, the cruel evacuation of Air, for which there was no
administrative excuse save that of short-sighted expediency, made
it infinitely more difficult to obtain information regarding the
origin and habits of a people who are in any case probably doomed
to disappear before the advance of civilisation. The records in
their mosques were abandoned to be rained on and gradually
destroyed. Tradition is being lost among a younger generation in a
new environment. In 1922 the policy of the French was reversed and
the population was being encouraged to return to their homes, but
one is inclined to wonder whether it was not already too late.</p>
<p>In the course of my stay in Air I heard of two books on tribal
lore and history. The one which appeared the most important had
belonged to the family of Ahodu, chief of Auderas village, and had
long been in the possession of his forefathers. In 1917, when the
northern villages were cleared, the book was left in a
hiding-place, but all my<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_362">[362]</span> efforts and those of Ahodu to trace it were
in vain. Later I heard of another similar work at Agades, but only
after I had left the town. It is kept by a woman called Taburgula,
and is quoted by the Kel Geres as their authority for the nobility,
etc. of the tribes of the south.<a id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>
<p>Certain extracts from a Chronicle of Air have been collected and
translated by H. R. Palmer, Lieut.-Governor of Northern Nigeria.
The information was contained in the notes of a Hausa scribe, who
seems to have compiled them on the authority of a manuscript which
is probably still extant in Air. The compilation is not necessarily
accurate, but ranks as good material, and has already been referred
to in previous chapters as the Agades Chronicle.<a id=
"FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class=
"fnanchor">[357]</a></p>
<p>Finally, there is the record of Sultan Bello, Emir of Sokoto,
when Denham and Clapperton reached the Sudan in 1824. Bello was a
great historian, and probably the most enlightened ruler in Africa
of his day. He has left for us a history without which we should
find it difficult to piece together the story of Air and the
neighbouring countries.<a id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>
<p>Such information as it was possible to obtain to supplement
these authorities and Jean and Barth was derived from numerous
conversations with the older men whom I met in Air. By repetition
and sifting it acquired sufficient consistency probably to
represent, somewhat approximately, the truth. Apart from an
inadequate knowledge of the language, I encountered another great
difficulty in research. The years 1917 and 1918 were so calamitous
for the Tuareg that circumstances obliged them to change many of
their habits of life and scattered their traditions. There was
always a danger of being misled by assuming that present practices
represented historical customs, or that deductions<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> made in 1922 were necessarily
as accurate as if the observations had been made in 1850.</p>
<p>The early history of Air may be resolved into the answers to the
three problems: When did the Tuareg reach Air? Where did they come
from? And, whom did they meet on arrival? We shall deal with the
last first, piecing together such scanty evidence as is at our
disposal.</p>
<p>The existence at an early date in North Africa of negroid people
much further north than their present limit of permanent habitation
is generally admitted. It is logical to suppose that Air, which is
an eminently habitable land, was therefore originally occupied by a
negroid race. In support of this supposition there is the testimony
of Muhammad el Bakeir,<a id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> son of Sultan Muhammad
el Addal, to the effect that the Goberawa originally possessed Air,
under the leadership of “Kipti” or Copts. Bello adds that the
Goberawa were a free people and that they were the noblest of the
Hausa-speaking races. It is not clear what the mention of Kipti can
mean, except that the influence of the Egyptian Coptic church was
spread as far afield as Air;<a id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and this is possible,
for traces of Christianity from the Nile Valley can probably be
found in the Chad area. It may, on the other hand, merely mean that
there was a North African element in the racial composition of the
Goberawa; and this is certainly true, for the Hausa people are not
pure Negroes. Gober was the most northern Hausa state, and later
the home of Othman dan Fodio, the founder of the Fulani
empire.<a id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class=
"fnanchor">[361]</a> The Agades Chronicle states that the people of
Daura, who are regarded as the purest of the Hausa, whatever this
people or race may eventually be proved to be, first ruled in Air;
but they grew weak and were conquered by the Kanuri, who in their
turn gave place to the Goberawa.</p>
<p>Asben is the name by which Air is still known in the Southland,
and the word is probably of the same root as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_364">[364]</span> “Abyssinia” and the Arabic “Habesh.” It
may also perhaps be found in the name Agisymba Regio, but no
significance need be attached to this, for the name seems to have
been applied very widely in Africa to countries inhabited by
negroid people.<a id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362"
class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
<p>The exact ethnic origin of the first negroid inhabitants of Air
or their order does not signify very much, once their racial
character is established. Although at first sight the presence of
negroids might seem to account for the peculiar aspect of the city
of Agades, its true explanation, as we have seen, must be sought
elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class=
"fnanchor">[363]</a> The date of the foundation of Agades is
considerably later than the displacement of the early inhabitants
of Air by the advent of the first Tuareg.</p>
<p>In addition to the negroid people of Air, the first Tuareg are
said by Bello to have found some Sanhaja in the country, by which
term he presumably means some Western Muleththemin, who lived in
the first or second of Leo’s zones. This is to some extent
confirmed by Ibn Batutah’s accounts of the tribes which he
encountered in these parts, but I have been unable to trace their
descendants with any degree of certainty. Some of their descendants
may probably be found in Azawagh and Damergu;<a id=
"FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class=
"fnanchor">[364]</a> the Mesufa of Ibn Batutah are also quite
likely to have been Sanhaja. Another tribe of the same name and
origin occurs in North-west Morocco.</p>
<p>The Goberawa capital at this time was T’in Shaman, like the
later Agades lying at the southern borders of the country, a site
naturally likely to be selected by a people of equatorial origin
with homes further south. T’in Shaman or Ansaman is stated by Barth
to have been some twenty miles from Agades on the road to Auderas;
but I conceive this may be a slip. I was only able to find the name
applied in Air to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
the wells of T’in Shaman, which lie in the direction given, but
scarcely two miles from the city, near the site of the present
French fort. Although the name appears to be a Libyan form it does
not follow that the town was of Tuareg origin or was inhabited by
them in early Goberawa days. Record of it has come to us from
Tuareg sources, referable to a period when Tuareg and Goberawa were
living side by side in Air, but we do not know the Goberawa form of
the name. These two folk were both in the area before the first
Tuareg immigration, when Libyan influence was already strong in
Air, and also after the first immigration, but before the second
brought in a sufficient number of Tuareg to effect the expulsion of
the Goberawa.<a id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365"
class="fnanchor">[365]</a> A certain degree of civilisation must
have existed in Air even in these early days, for several learned
men, inhabitants of T’in Shaman, are mentioned by the historians of
Negroland.<a id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class=
"fnanchor">[366]</a> That it was not a Tuareg town is further shown
by the information recorded, that when Agades was eventually
founded in the fifteenth century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>, it
was from Ir n’Allem and not from T’in Shaman: Ir n’Allem may be
doubtfully identified with a site north of Agades well within the
defending hills near Solom Solom.<a id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Of greater interest
perhaps is the close analogy between the names of T’in Shaman or
Ansaman and Nasamones, that great tribe of travellers on the Great
Syrtis described by Herodotus. There is no doubt that with such
caravaneers as we know lived in the north, the influence of the
Tuareg in Air and the South generally must have been great for a
long time before they settled there.</p>
<p>Into Air, inhabited by negroids and Sanhaja, came the modern
Tuareg of Air. What happened to the Goberawa in the process of time
as a consequence of this movement can easily be assumed. Whatever
may have been the terms of a peaceful settlement, the negroid
people were either driven back into Central Africa here as
elsewhere, or they became the serfs<a id=
"FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class=
"fnanchor">[368]</a> of the conquerors, and were
incorporated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span> into
the race as Imghad tribes. The darker element among them must
certainly in part be accounted for in this manner.</p>
<p>The modern Tuareg immigrants can broadly be divided into the
three categories, of which the exact significance has already
become apparent. They are the Kel Owi tribes who came into the
country quite recently, the Kel Geres tribes and those septs
collectively known as the People of the King. Of these, the Kel
Geres, as well as a once separate but now associated tribe, the
Itesan, are no longer in Air, but live in an area north of Sokoto,
whither they migrated in comparatively recent times. It requires to
be established whether the people who came to Air before the Kel
Owi, all arrived at much the same time, or in different waves, when
the respective movements took place, and who in each case were the
immigrants.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The First Immigration</span></h3>
<p>Before attacking these problems, it will be necessary, because
relevant to their solution, to consider the direction from which
the invasion took place. Tuareg traditions without any exception
ascribe a northern home to the race. They maintain that they
reached Air from that direction in different waves at different
times and by different routes. Ask any Tuareg of the older tribes
about the history of his people and he will say, for instance: “My
people, the Kel Tadek, have been in the country since the beginning
of the world,” but he will add in the same breath: “But we are a
people from the north, from far away, not like the niggers of the
south.” They have a story to the effect that the Sultan of Stambul,
seeing how North Africa was over-populated,<a id=
"FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class=
"fnanchor">[369]</a> ordered the tribes which had taken refuge on
the borders of the Libyan desert in the region of Aujila and the
Eastern Fezzan to migrate and spread the true religion far afield.
The Tuareg, with the Itesan leading, thereupon came into Air. Now,
whatever else they were,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_367">[367]</span> the Libyans at the time of these early
movements were, of course, not Moslems, nor is it likely that any
Khalif or Emperor at Constantinople intervened in the way
suggested. There is not even any reason to suppose that the
migration occurred in the Moslem era, though we are not as yet
concerned with dates. Such details as these are picturesque
embellishments added in the course of time to popular tradition. I
can agree that the Tuareg came <em>from</em> the north; but I am
less than certain that they came <em>by</em> the north.</p>
<p>North of Air, about half-way between the wells of Asiu and the
Valley of T’iyut, there is a small hill called Maket n’Ikelan,
which means in Temajegh, “The Mecca (or shrine) of the
Slaves.”<a id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class=
"fnanchor">[370]</a> This is said to have been the northernmost
boundary of the old kingdom of Gober. At Maket n’Ikelan the custom
was preserved among passing Tuareg caravans of allowing the slaves
to make merry and dance and levy a small tribute from their
masters. The hill was probably a pagan place of worship, but is
important from the historical point of view, because tradition
represents, somewhat erroneously as regards details, that there,
“when the Kel Owi took possession of old Gober with its capital at
T’in Shaman, a compromise was entered into between the Red
conquerors and the Black natives, that the latter should not be
destroyed and that the principal chief of the Kel Owi should be
allowed to marry a black woman.” The story is interesting, though
there has evidently been a slight confusion of thought, because
there was already a large Tuareg population in Air before the Kel
Owi came comparatively late in history; and it is not they who were
the first Tuareg in the plateau. The marriage of the red chief with
a black slave woman may be an allusion, and perhaps a direct one,
to the practice associated with the Sultan of Air.<a id=
"FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class=
"fnanchor">[371]</a></p>
<p>With the old frontier of Gober at Maket n’Ikelan one<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span> might from this story have
supposed that the first Tuareg invaders met the original
inhabitants of the country there and came to an agreement regarding
an occupation of the northern mountains, whence they eventually
overran the whole plateau. Although such a conclusion would seem to
be borne out by such traditions as I have quoted of a descent from
the north, the weight of evidence indicates the south-east as the
direction from which the first Tuareg actually came. But this will
be seen to be not incompatible with a northern home for the race.
The view is only in conflict with the Maket n’Ikelan tradition if
the latter is interpreted literally. The terms of the settlement of
treaty need only be associated with a point in Northern Air,
inasmuch as the site in question marked the frontier of the old
kingdom of Gober, which the Tuareg eventually took over in its
entirety from its ancient possessors. It need not be supposed that
the Treaty was made <em>at</em> Maket n’Ikelan. I regard this old
frontier point as merely symbolic of the event.</p>
<p>The testimony of Sultan Bello regarding the first migration of
the People of the Veil is most helpful.<a id=
"FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class=
"fnanchor">[372]</a> “Adjoining Bornu, on the south side, is the
province of Air (<em>i.e.</em> on the south side of Air). It is
inhabited by the Tuareg and by some remnants of the Sanhaja and the
Sudanese. This province was formerly in the hands of the Sudanese
inhabitants of Gober, but five tribes of the Tuareg, called
Amakeetan, Tamkak, Sendal, Agdalar, and Ajaraneen, came out of
Aowjal<a id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class=
"fnanchor">[373]</a> and conquered it. They nominated a prince for
themselves from the family of Ansatfen, but they quarrelled among
themselves and dismissed him.” Bello thereupon goes on to describe
the Arabian origin of the Tuareg people.</p>
<p>I agree with Barth<a id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> that these five tribes
probably did not come from Aujila oasis itself, but his remark that
one of the five tribes was “the Aujila tribe” is surely a
mistake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> Bello
distinctly speaks of the five tribes by name as having come
<em>from</em> Aowjal. Aujila seems never to have been the name of a
people. As far back as Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> it is already a place
name. As for Bello’s reference to the selection of a ruler from a
slave family, it is probably an allusion to the practice we have
already examined,<a id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376"
class="fnanchor">[376]</a> for Ansatfen, <em>i.e.</em> n’Sattafan,
means “of the black ones,” from the word “sattaf” = “black.” The
fact that according to the Agades Chronicle the ninth Sultan was
called Muhammad Sottofé (the Black), who ruled from <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 1486-93, and is referred to in Sudanese records,
in some measure confirms the accuracy of Bello’s history.</p>
<p>The story that the first Tuareg came from Aujila is nothing more
than a reflection of their own tradition that they came from a far
country in the north-east, where one of the most important and
well-known points was this oasis, whence people had long been in
the habit of trading as far afield as Kawar and even Gao. Aujila
was a northern caravan terminus. The trade between Aujila and
Kawar, as early as the twelfth century, is referred to by
Idrisi,<a id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class=
"fnanchor">[377]</a> and this reference is the more interesting as
it indicates, though at a later period than that of the first
Tuareg invasion of Air, a steady stream of traffic organised by the
North-eastern Tuareg down the Chad road to Bornu and Kanem. This is
most significant; it had probably been going on since the days
perhaps of the Nasamonian merchant adventurers.</p>
<p>The Agades Chronicle, on the authority of the learned Ibn
Assafarani, says that the first Tuareg who came to Air were the Kel
Innek, under a ruler called the Agumbulum; and that other Tuareg
followed them. Now, Kel Innek means literally “The People of the
East”; it is primarily a generic or descriptive term, and not a
tribal proper name. Ibn Assafarani wrote from Asben, where the
eastern country always and necessarily means the area around Lake
Chad. Bello further mentions that when the Kanuri entered
Kanem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span> they settled
there as strangers under the government of the Amakeetan, one of
the five tribes previously mentioned as the first to enter Air. He
also refers to the latter by the general name of Kel Innek. Again,
one of the two tribes in Elakkos, between Air and Lake Chad, are
the Immikitan, while we know from Leo that the Lemta Tuareg
occupied an area extending from the north-eastern Fezzan to Kuka on
Lake Chad.<a id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class=
"fnanchor">[378]</a> This evidence, therefore, leads one to the
conclusion that the first Tuareg, or at any rate some of the first
Tuareg, to enter Air were not migrants from the north, that is to
say, from Ghat or Ahaggar, but from Kanem and from Bornu in the
south-east, which parts are racially connected with the Fezzan and
not with the former areas. In the course of these movements a group
of Immikitan remained in Elakkos, which, we have seen on the quite
distinct evidence of the Ilagwas, was in any case connected with
the Lemta country of the north.</p>
<p>There exists to-day a sub-tribe of the Itesan bearing the name
of Kel Innek. On the analogy of what occurred among the Kel
Ahamellen, among the Ahaggaren, and in recent years in Air also
among the Kel Tafidet, it is almost certain that we have an example
here of a name originally applied to a sub-tribe and the whole
group simultaneously but now used to differentiate a sub-tribe
only. The Itesan of to-day, in spite of their connection with the
Kel Geres, were, as will be explained later on, among the original
invaders of Air, a fact which might in any case have been deduced
from the survival among them, and not among other confederations,
of the name Kel Innek.</p>
<p>It appears unnecessary when such an easy interpretation of the
available evidence is forthcoming, and above all when some of the
names accurately recorded by Bello are still traceable in Air, to
assume that they are erroneous. I cannot follow Barth at all when
he is dealing with these early tribes. He seems to have created
difficulties where they do not exist. It is not necessary to
suppose that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
five tribes came into Air to form an entrepôt for their trade
between Negroland and Aujila or the north-east generally; the
suggestion is so far-fetched that even Barth admitted that the
whole affair was peculiar.<a id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>
<p>If an invasion of Air from the south-east took place, what
provoked it? In order to establish even an approximate date, which
Jean puts at about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 800, without,
however, giving his reasons, a digression into the story of Bornu
is necessary.</p>
<p>Bello, referring to the people east of Lake Chad, mentions an
early invasion from the Yemen as far as Bornu. He calls the
invaders “Barbars,”<a id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a> which name, however, he seems later to
transfer to the Tuareg, finally, however, reserving it for the
Kanuri. Europeans nowadays, adding considerably to the confusion,
have called the Libyans “Berbers” and the Kanuri “Beriberi.” The
invasion from the Yemen is reported to have taken place under
Himyer, but on the showing of El Masa’udi’s history, probably the
most valuable for so mythical a period, Himyer has been confused
with another hero, Ifrikos. There are other references to an
invasion from Arabia across Africa in various authorities,
including Ibn Khaldun. Whether the invaders were the Kanuri, as the
name “Barbar” given to them by Bello seems to imply, or whether
they displaced the Kanuri, causing the latter to move into Kanem
and settle as strangers under the rule of the Immikitan, then
resident in that region, or whether, in fine, the Kanuri are not a
race but a congeries of people, it is both difficult and irrelevant
here to determine. In the first case there are no difficulties
about the application of the name Barbar to the Kanuri; in the
second, the participation of the Kanuri in a movement connected
with a people from Arabia might easily lead Bello to a confusion
resulting in his identification of the Kanuri with, and his
application of Barbar to, the latter. After the settlement of the
Kanuri in Kanem and Bornu<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_372">[372]</span> under the Tuareg, the name Barbar,
originally that of the subject people, came to be applied to the
inhabitants of the country as a whole, thus including the Tuareg.
The persistence of the name is the more easily accounted for by the
predominance later on of the people to whom it originally belonged,
in spite of their situation in the beginning, for, as we shall see
later, the Tuareg, their masters in the early days, were gradually
displaced in Kanem and Bornu at a period which might coincide with
their invasion of Air.</p>
<p>The history of Kanem and Bornu, at first under a single
government, is recorded in a chronicle collected by Barth.<a id=
"FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class=
"fnanchor">[381]</a> It is, of course, not entirely trustworthy,
but the salient facts are reasonably correct. The first king of
Kanem, Sef, doubtfully referred to about <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 850, founded a dynasty and reigned over
Berbers,<a id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class=
"fnanchor">[382]</a> Tebu, and people of Kanem. This dynasty,
called Duguwa, after the name of the grandson of Sef, continued
until the end of the reign of Abd el Jelil or Selma I, who was
succeeded in 1086 by Hume, the first king of the Beni Hume dynasty.
Hume was reputed to be the son of Selma I, and the change of name
in the ruling dynasty is attributed to the fact that the former was
the first Moslem ruler,<a id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> whereas his predecessors
were not. The chronology is confirmed by El Bekri’s
statement,<a id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class=
"fnanchor">[384]</a> written towards the end of the Beni Dugu
dynasty, that Arki, the ante-penultimate king of the line in 1067,
was a pagan. The dynastic change of name is even more important
when the ethnic relation of the kings of the Beni Dugu and the Beni
Hume are examined. During the period of the Beni Dugu, Bornu,
according to Sultan Bello, was under the rule of the Tuareg. In the
Chronicle two of the Duguwa kings are stated to have had mothers of
the Temagheri tribe, while another was descended from a woman of
the Beni Ghalgha bearing the Libyan name of Tumayu. The
name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span> Beni Ghalgha
reminds one perhaps only fortuitously of the Kel Ghela,<a id=
"FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class=
"fnanchor">[385]</a> while Temagheri may simply be a variant for
Temajegh, which of course is the female form in the Air dialect of
Imajegh, meaning a Tuareg noble, though I am told this etymology is
unlikely. The importance of the women in the ancestry of these
kings, as among all the Tuareg, is emphasised by the mention of
their names. With the Beni Hume, on the other hand, the alliances
seem to have been contracted, no longer with Tuareg women, but from
Hume’s successor, Dunama I, till the reign of Abd el Jelil or Selma
II, with Tebu women. In any event there are good reasons to believe
that the change in the name of the dynasty at the end of Selma I’s
reign in 1086 means more than a mere change in religion; it marks
the passing of the power of the Tuareg in Bornu.<a id=
"FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class=
"fnanchor">[386]</a></p>
<p>The year 1086 may therefore also mark approximately the first
wave of the Tuareg migration into Air. The immigration was probably
gradual, since tradition records no single event or cataclysm to
account for the changes which took place, which have, on the
contrary, to be deduced from stories like that of Maket n’Ikelan
and the change in the name of a dynasty. But 1086 is probably the
latest date of the migration into Air and it may have been earlier.
The invaders were the five tribes already mentioned, together with
or including others which it would be difficult to trace by name,
though one of them was probably the Itesan. All the tribes
concerned can be traced among the People of the King, most of them
in Air, though the Igdalen are on the south-eastern fringe of the
plateau. The Itesan, whose dominant position in Air involved them
in the vicissitudes of the Kel Geres, shared in their expulsion
from the mountains.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
But the others belong to the Amenokal, and none of them to that
later personage, the Añastafidet.</p>
<p>The Beni Hume dynasty in Bornu may be regarded as a Tebu dynasty
or a negroid dynasty with Tebu alliances. The Chronicle makes this
line continue until its expulsion from Kanem by the Bulala, a
negroid people from east of Lake Chad, early in the fourteenth
century, and its final extinction with the Bulala conquest of Bornu
itself in the fifteenth century. The Beni Hume line seems in
reality to have terminated in 1177, when Abdallah, or Dala, came to
the throne. His half-brother, Selma II, is described as the first
black king of Bornu, his predecessors having been fair-skinned like
the Arabs. It is this reign which really seems to mark the advent
to power of the negroid Kanuri, to which Bello makes allusion, even
if it is not to be looked for earlier with the rise of the Beni
Hume themselves. Bello describes the occurrence in the following
terms:<a id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class=
"fnanchor">[387]</a> “They came to Kanem and settled there as
strangers under the government of the Tawarek . . . but they soon
rebelled against them and usurped the country.” But I am
nevertheless not disposed to consider the Beni Hume negroid Kanuri,
so much as a Tebu or similar stock,<a id=
"FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class=
"fnanchor">[388]</a> for, in the reign of Dunama II, the son of
Selma II, we find, after a series of marriages with Tebu women, an
apparently definite change of policy. No more Tebu women are
recorded as the mothers of kings, and instead the great Dunama II,
who ruled from 1221 to 1259, waged a war which lasted seven years,
seven months and seven days against these people. As the result of
this campaign he extended the jurisdiction of the empire of Kanem
over the Fezzan, which remained within its borders for over a
century.<a id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class=
"fnanchor">[389]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>The fall of the
Duguwa in Bornu at the end of the eleventh century was, then, the
ultimate reason for the first Tuareg invasion of Air. We should
thus have a fairly satisfactory date were it not probably to be
regarded only as the latest limiting date, since the overthrow of
the Tuareg dynasty probably only marked the culmination in Bornu of
a steadily growing ethnic pressure from the east and north. An
additional reason for assuming a late date for the invasion of Air
is the detail recorded by Bello, that when the Kel Innek arrived
they found some Sanhaja tribes already there. Now the true Sanhaja
confederation was not brought into being until the beginning of the
eleventh century, the most probable period for tribes of this
division to have wandered as far afield as Air. It follows that the
invasion of the Kel Innek should be placed later than that or
towards the end of the century.</p>
<p>There is scarcely any evidence regarding the earliest period at
which it might have taken place. It may be possible to arrive at an
estimate, when the results of further researches into the history
of Bornu have been made public. It would be most interesting to
learn, for instance, when the first Tuareg reached Bornu and Kanem.
Is their presence there as a ruling caste to be ascribed to the
very early days, or are they to be considered as having come in at
a comparatively late epoch? It is difficult to reconcile their
presence there in the earliest times with their failure to fuse to
a greater extent with the local negroid population and their
consequent retention of the individuality which they still
possessed when they entered Air.</p>
<p>In the four centuries preceding <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
850, when the first Beni Dugu king ascended the throne, there are
no recorded events in North Africa very likely to have caused
extensive emigration of the Tuareg of the Fezzan to Equatoria,
other than the Arab conquest; the only other invasion, that of
Chosroes with the Persians in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 616,
does not seem to have had a far-reaching effect, or to have been
accompanied by foreign immigration on a large scale. The first
invasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> of the
Arabs in the seventh century was only small and at first did not
cause widespread ethnic disturbances.<a id=
"FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class=
"fnanchor">[390]</a> Okba invaded the Fezzan in <span class=
"sc2">A.H.</span> 46 with only a small expeditionary force; the
previous expedition of <span class="sc2">A.H.</span> 26 was
probably not larger. Arab pressure only began to become intense in
the eighth century, when the conquest of Spain after Tariq’s
exploits in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 710 had become an
accomplished fact. And then there followed another pause until the
Hillalian invasion in the eleventh century took place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the presence of Tuareg in the earliest days
in the lands east of Lake Chad would find some justification in the
position recorded of the Temahu in the southern part of the Libyan
desert by Egyptian records. They might also explain the mysterious
Blemmyes and the Men with Eyes in their Stomachs referred to by the
classical authors.</p>
<p>On the whole I prefer not to speculate too much along these
lines for fear of plunging into deep waters connected with the
people of the upper Nile basin. I shall simply regard the Tuareg of
Bornu as a part of the Lemta of the Fezzan, which we may assume
from various sources they were. In consequence, however slender the
evidence, it becomes difficult to avoid the conclusion that the
Tuareg reached Bornu from the north along the Bilma road in the
course of the Arab invasions of the eighth century. They remained
as rulers of the country until they were driven from there also, in
consequence of increasing Arab pressure in the Fezzan and in
Equatoria itself, for in the middle of the eleventh century the
Hillal and Soleim Arabs are found extending their conquests as far
as Central Africa. Their fighting under Abu Zeid el Hillali against
the Alamt (Lemta) Tuareg in the Fezzan is still remembered in the
traditions of the Equatorial Arab tribes.</p>
<p>All we can say with any degree of certainty is that somewhere
between the eighth and eleventh centuries the Lemta Tuareg
eventually emigrated from the Chad countries.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_377">[377]</span> In due course the first five tribes
reached Air, with Elakkos and Damergu behind them already occupied.
But in Air they only peopled the whole land later on. Some of the
Tuareg of this emigration never entered Air at all or stayed in
Damergu, but moved still further west to form with other groups
from the north the Tademekkat and Kel el Suk, as well as some of
the communities of Tuareg on the Niger. Subsequent historical
events isolated the Air tribes, and when other waves of Tuareg
joined them, their original relationship with the western Tuareg
and the Aulimmiden had been forgotten. The origin of the latter is
to be explained in this wise, and not by supposing that they
arrived from Mauretania, as Barth would have it.<a id=
"FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class=
"fnanchor">[391]</a> The further westward movement of the Tuareg
from Lake Chad is borne out by a reference in Ibn Khaldun’s works
to some Itesan<a id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a> under the name of Beni Itisan among the
Sanhaja.</p>
<p>Tradition represents that the oldest people in Air are those
known to-day as the People of the King and the Itesan to whom the
most evolved handiwork in the plateau, including the deep wells, is
attributed. With the Itesan are associated all the older and more
remarkable houses in Air. The form and construction of these
buildings evidently had a great influence on the subsequent
inhabitants, but as they are all found in an already evolved type,
it is clear that the tradition and experience necessary for
building them must have been brought from elsewhere. In accepting
the view that these houses are the work of the Itesan and not of
the later immigrants I can only follow the unanimous opinion of the
natives to-day, who are, if anything, too prone to attribute
anything remarkable to them. It may, of course, be discovered later
that the Itesan had nothing to do with any of these works, and it
is all the more curious that in their present habitat north of
Sokoto they should have shown no similar architectural
propensities. It is also strange<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_378">[378]</span> that most of the “Kel names” among the
Itesan are derived from places west of the Central massifs, while
most of the large settlements containing the best so-called
“Itesan” houses are on the east side. But the houses and wells in
Air do not seem to be associated with the Kel Geres, with whom the
Itesan now live, and there seems to be no doubt whatever in the
minds of the natives that they are the works of the latter and not
of other immigrants.</p>
<p>The architectural technique shows that the race was in process
of cultural decay when it reached Air, and that under the influence
of new environment the memory and tradition of this civilisation
were lost with remarkable rapidity. The succession of events and
the causes culminating in the migration of the Chad Tuareg are not
inconsistent with such a decline of culture, but only a thorough
investigation of the Fezzan will probably throw any light upon its
derivation.</p>
<p>The popular view of the origin of these stone buildings bears
out the separate identity of the Itesan and the Kel Geres. It is
obvious that the two divisions must have entered Air at different
times; and since the Itesan were therefore among the first
invaders, the Kel Geres must have come in later. This traditional
version is further consistent with facts already noticed, in that
among the People of the King in Air and among the Itesan it is
possible to trace the names of the first recorded tribes to enter
Air, whereas their names do not occur among the Kel Geres. Apart
from proving the separate origin of the Itesan and the Kel Geres,
these facts leave little room for doubt that the Itesan formed part
of the group that was the first to invade the plateau.</p>
<p>The names of the five tribes, mentioned by Bello in his history,
were, as we have seen above, the Immikitan, the Igdalen, the
Ijaranen, the Tamgak, and the Sendal. Of these the Immikitan are
found with the Igdalen among the People of the King in Air to-day,
while the Ijaranen survive among the Itesan tribes who now live in
the south. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
Sendal and the Tamgak are mentioned as late as 1850 in the Agades
Chronicle, when there is no doubt that they were a people of the
king, since they are referred to as the allies of the Sultan Abd el
Qader in a war against the Kel Geres.</p>
<p>The first Tuareg lived in Air as a minority and as foreigners.
It is possible they represented only a fraction of the Tuareg who
were moving and that the greater part went on into the west. The
Agades Chronicle, describing the advent of the Itesan, records that
they “. . . . said to the Goberawa, ‘We want a place in your town
to settle.’ The Goberawa refused at first to give them a place, but
in the end agreed. The Itesan refused the place as a gift, but
bought a house for 1000 dinars. Into this house they led their
chief, and from there he ruled the Tuareg of the desert. War,
however, soon ensued between the Goberawa, supported by the
Abalkoran, and the Itesan. The result of this war was that the
Goberawa went back into Hausaland, while the Abalkoran went west
into the land of the Aulimmiden.” The Abalkoran had just before in
the Chronicle been described as a priestly caste associated with
the Goberawa, but among the Air Tuareg the name Iberkoran or
Abalkoran is the name of the Aulimmiden themselves. The record has
suffered chronological compression, but clearly implies that the
Goberawa were still in South Air at a time when the Aulimmiden had
already reached their habitat west of the mountains. The latter is
an event which some authorities consider fairly recent, but my
view, already put forward elsewhere, is that the Aulimmiden are not
a group of Hawara people who left the Fezzan some time between 1200
and 1300, as Ibn Khaldun suggests, nor yet people from Mauretania;
I prefer to believe that they are Lemta who originally migrated to
their present habitat from the Chad regions at much the same time
as the first Tuareg invasion of Air took place.</p>
<p>The statement that the Abalkoran left Air to join the Aulimmiden
tends to support the view that this Air invasion was only part of a
general westerly movement.</p>
<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span><span class=
"sc">The Second Immigration</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> second wave of immigration was that
of the Kel Geres. Jean believed that the Kel Geres were among the
first arrivals because he wrongly assumed that they were identical
with the Itesan. An examination of the names of the various
groups<a id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class=
"fnanchor">[393]</a> discloses the fact that whereas many Itesan
tribes have “Kel names” derived from known localities in Central
Air, for the most part in the Auderas neighbourhood, of the Kel
Geres tribes only the Kel Garet, Kel Anigara and the Kel Agellal
have names similarly derived.<a id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Traditionally the Kel
Geres reached Air by way of the north. They also are associated
with the story of over-population in the Mediterranean lands. They
arrived, according to Jean, in considerable numbers, and settled in
the part of Air which is west of the road from Iferuan to Agades by
way of Assode and Auderas.<a id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> East of this line in
later days lived the Kel Owi, and presumably, at this early period,
the original five tribes. The assumption is confirmed by certain
evidence, for although the Itesan tribe names refer to an area
lying across this line, the only territorial Kel Geres tribe names
refer to an area west of it; the country, on the other hand, known
to have been occupied by some of the first immigrants is, as would
be expected, to the east. With the exception of the Igdalen, who
moved in recent years, most of the older People of the King were
also east of this line, before the Kel Owi scattered them.</p>
<p>The present Itesan-Kel Geres group in the Southland is said to
number forty-seven tribes divided as follows:<a id=

<p>The principal tribal names of the Itesan which retain the more
familiar place names of Air are the Kel Mafinet, Kel T’sidderak,
Kel Dogam and Kel Bagezan or Maghzen, all of them derived from
places in the neighbourhood of Auderas.<a id=
"FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class=
"fnanchor">[397]</a> Among the Kel Geres the name of the Kel Garet
records a habitat somewhat further north, the Kel Agellal of the
Kel Unnar probably came from Agellal, and the Kel Anigara from an
area still further north.</p>
<p>It is difficult to accept the view that the first Tuareg to
enter Air arrived in the eighth century, even if it is only for the
reason that the surviving “Itesan” houses could not for so long a
time have remained in the state of preservation in which some of
them are now found. I am personally not disposed to regard the
first immigration as having taken place much before the latest date
previously suggested as a limit, namely, the end of the eleventh
century.</p>
<p>The invasion of the first tribes left the mountains with a mixed
population of Tuareg and Goberawa; the disappearance of the latter
as a separate race was only accomplished when the second or Kel
Geres invasion took place. The Kel Geres so added to the Tuareg
population in Air that henceforward the country must be regarded as
essentially Tuareg, and this probably accounts for the tradition
that the Kel Geres conquered the country, and as they came in both
from the north and by the north, it doubtless gave rise to legends
such as that of Maket n’Ikelan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>Failing more
definite evidence than we now possess, I regard the Kel Geres
movement as a part of a Hawara-Auriga emigration from the north to
which Ibn Khaldun alludes. This does not exclude the possibility of
some nuclei of Hawara having gone west of Air to join either the
Aulimmiden or the Tademekkat or both groups. In fact, such a course
of events would explain the distant affinity with, yet independence
of, the Aulimmiden which is insisted upon by many authorities. We
know that by the time Leo was writing he regarded both Ahaggar and
Air as inhabited by Targa, while the Fezzan and the Chad road were
inhabited by Lemta. The Ahaggaren I have previously tried to show
were, in the main, Hawara. Now the advent in Air of a large mass
from this division under the name of Kel Geres would warrant his
grouping of both plateaux under one ethnic heading. The Hawara
movement from the Western Fezzan and between Ghat and Ahaggar may
be placed in the twelfth century, and therefore not so very far
removed from the first immigration into Air from the south-east. It
can also be accounted for by similar causes, namely, the growing
pressure of the Arabs, perhaps as a sequel to the Hillalian
invasion.</p>
<p>Following the two initial migrations, it may be assumed that
small nuclei of Tuareg continued to reach Air. These would to-day
be represented by such of the People of the King as are not to be
connected with either the first five tribes or with the Kel
Geres.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Third Immigration</span></h3>
<p>The third wave was that of the Kel Owi. On Barth and Hornemann’s
authority they arrived in modern times, while according to Jean
they arrived in the ninth century. Barth’s researches, which in all
cases are more reliable than those of Jean, who appears usually to
have accepted native dates without hesitation, led him to believe
that the Kel Owi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
entered, in fact conquered Air, about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1740. They are not mentioned by Leo or any other writers before the
time of Hornemann (<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1800), who
obtained such good information about them that his commentator,
Major Rennell, also assumed their arrival to be recent.<a id=
"FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class=
"fnanchor">[398]</a> By the end of the nineteenth century the Kel
Owi had already achieved such fame that of all Tuareg known to him,
Hornemann only mentions them. He adds in his account that Gober was
at this time tributary to Air, a detail consistent with other
records. Barth’s very late date<a id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> for the arrival of the
Kel Owi nevertheless presents certain difficulties. It is clear on
the one hand that it could not have been the Kel Owi who made the
arrangement of Maket n’Ikelan, and that it must therefore have been
the Kel Geres or their predecessors, but it is further difficult to
see how a people could have entered Air in such numbers as to
become the preponderant group within barely one hundred years and
to have evicted the firmly rooted Kel Geres tribes so soon. That
the Kel Owi should have appropriated the historical credit for the
settlement of Maket n’Ikelan is easy to understand, for it was they
who held the trade route to the north out of the country, but the
early expulsion of the Kel Geres indicates a numerical superiority
which, unfortunately, native tradition does not bear out.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that no Kel Owi tribe is represented in the
election of the king, which supports the view that they had not yet
reached Air when the local system of government from Agades was
devised.</p>
<p>“The vulgar account of the origin of the Kel Owi from the female
slave of a Tinylcum who came to Asben where she gave birth to a boy
who was the progenitor of the Kel Owi . . . is obviously nothing
but a popular tale. . . .”<a id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>
<p>The story collected by Jean, which purports to
explain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span> the two
categories of tribes in Air to-day, the Kel Owi confederation and
the People of the King, is not more authentic.<a id=
"FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class=
"fnanchor">[401]</a> He tells how, after the arrival of the Sultan
in Air, the Kel Geres kept away from his presence, while the Kel
Owi ingratiated themselves and secured their own administration
under the Añastafidet. The Sultan, however, wishing to create his
own tribal group, divided the Kel Owi amongst themselves, and this
is the origin of the People of the Añastafidet and the People of
the King. In their efforts to ingratiate themselves, the Kel Owi of
Bagezan which, as we have seen, was Itesan country at the time,
sent as a present to the Sultan a woman named T’iugas with her six
daughters of the Imanen tribe of the north; these women had been
sent from the north to cement good relations between Air and
Azger.<a id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class=
"fnanchor">[402]</a> The six sisters nominated the eldest as their
speaker and the Sultan gave her authority over the rest. She was
followed by the next two sisters, and these three are the mothers
of the three senior tribes of the Kel Owi, namely, the Kel Owi
proper, the Kel Tafidet and the Kel Azañieres.<a id=
"FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class=
"fnanchor">[403]</a> The other three women refused to accept the
leadership of the eldest sister and placed themselves under the
authority of the Sultan direct; and they were the mothers of the
Kel Tadek, Imezegzil and Kel Zilalet.<a id=
"FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class=
"fnanchor">[404]</a> The details of the story are obviously a Kel
Owi invention. They are designed to establish nobility and equality
of ancestry with the older and more respected tribes. The legend,
however, probably also contains certain indications of truth,
notably in the allusion to the Imanen women from the north, since
there does exist an affinity<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_385">[385]</span> between that tribe and the Itesan, though
it must, of course, be understood that the Kel Bagezan of the story
were an Itesan sub-tribe, and not the later Kel Bagezan of the Kel
Owi group. With these conditions the story becomes intelligible as
a legendary or traditional account. It is not meant to be taken as
literally true, and is not even a very widely accepted version of
the origin of the present social structure in Air, but it is
amusing, for it shows how on this as on every other occasion the
Kel Owi have attempted to claim antiquity of descent equal to that
of the tribes they found on their arrival.</p>
<p>Two other traditions which I collected are best summarised by
quoting the following extract from my diary, written while at
T’imia, a Kel Owi village in the Bagezan mountains. One of the big
men in the village was the “’alim” ’Umbellu, a fine figure of a
man, old and bald but still powerful and vigorous, with the heavy
noble features of a Roman emperor. He used to be the keeper of the
old mosque, and is said to be one of the most learned men in the
country. I had examined the ruined sanctuary, in which he had not
set foot since it was desecrated by the French troops after the
Kaossen revolt, and found some fragments of holy books, which I
restored to ’Umbellu in the present mosque at T’imia, a shelter of
reeds and matting. From him I received the same sort of confused
account which others besides myself had heard. “. . . He says that
the Kel Owi are not pure Tuareg, but that some Arabs <em>or</em>
(<em>sic</em>) Tuareg of the north came down to Northern Air and
mixed with the local population, which stock became the Kel Owi
Confederation; but whether these people came as raiders or settlers
he could not say. He was, however, quite clear that they had come
from the Arab country.<a id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Then in almost the same
breath he told me that the Kel Owi are descended from a woman who
came from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span> north
and lived in Tamgak, where she mated with one of the local
inhabitants and became the mother of all these tribes. He added
that she was a Moslem at a time when the Kel Ferwan (a non-Kel Owi
tribe, or People of the King, then living in Iferuan) were heathen,
but whether Christians or pagan he could not say.”</p>
<p>The second story is analogous to that which Barth heard.</p>
<p>Generally speaking traditions give the two separate versions,
which are rather puzzling. If the account of the woman who settled
in Tamgak is taken as a legendary record of the indigenous growth
of the Kel Owi tribes, it must be supposed that their forefathers
were in Air for much more than two hundred years, and Jean’s date
would consequently not be out of the question. Against this must be
set the other version, that they arrived quite recently, a view
which is supported unanimously by all the other Tuareg. It was, we
have seen, confirmed by Barth’s researches and deduced by Rennell
from information collected by Hornemann. The compact organisation
and the definite division which exists between them and the other
tribes in Air would also point to their having a separate origin
and being comparatively recent arrivals; they are still organised
in an administrative system which has not yet had time to break
down and merge into the régime of the other tribes. Furthermore, no
mention is made of the Kel Owi by any of the earlier authors,
which, if negative evidence, is nevertheless significant in the
works of an authority like Leo, especially as, apart from the
ethnic distinction which might have been overlooked, the dual
government of the King and the Añastafidet is too remarkable a
feature to have escaped his discernment. The balance of testimony
is therefore in favour of attributing a fairly recent date to their
arrival, though perhaps not so late as Barth would have us believe.
I myself make no doubt that they were late arrivals: I only differ
with the learned traveller in a small matter of the exact date.</p>
<p>But what impelled them to migrate it is difficult to
say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span> Barth thought
that they could be traced to an earlier habitat in the north-west,
and that the nobler portion of them once belonged to the Auraghen
tribe, whence their dialect was called Auraghiye. I have no
evidence on this point except that of Ahodu, who gave me to
understand that the language of the Kel Owi was not different from
that of any other Tuareg tribe in the plateau, and he added that he
had not heard the name Auraghiye employed to describe it, though he
knew that it was applied to the dialect spoken in Ahaggar. Barth’s
testimony, otherwise, is acceptable.</p>
<p>Jean is of the impression that they are essentially of the same
race as the Kel Geres, who were probably Hawara. If this deduction
is true, three possibilities require to be considered. The Kel Owi
may have been an Auraghen tribe living to the north or north-east
of Air among the Azger; or, they may have been among the older
Auraghen people, to use this term in its wider sense, namely, of
the Auriga-Hawara, represented by the Ahaggaren, to whom, of
course, the Azger Auraghen of to-day belong; or, lastly, they may
be descended from the Auraghen of the west, from the Tademekkat
country. The last is the soundest view in the present state of our
knowledge, though the second is also quite probable.</p>
<p>The Tademekkat people, we know, were driven from their homes in
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1640 by the Aulimmiden. While some of
them were driven out to the west, some at least found their way
back into the Azger country.<a id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> It is no less probable
that others may have gone to Air by a roundabout route. In that
case Barth’s date for the arrival of the Kel Owi in Air seems to be
at least fifty years too late. During the last half of the
sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries they would have been
finding their way into Northern Air in small groups. This is not
inconsistent with the appearance at Agades of an Amenokal with a
Kel Owi mother, if the admittedly tentative date of 1629 given in
the Agades Chronicle is placed a decade or so later.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>I am inclined to
regard the arrival of the Kel Owi in Air as having taken place in
the latter half of the seventeenth century. According to the Agades
Chronicle they were already fighting the Kel Geres at Abattul, west
of the Central massif, in 1728, some time before Barth’s date; and
this obviously implies an earlier arrival in the north of the
plateau, for their entry must have taken place from that direction
and not from the south. But a recent date, taken in conjunction
with the dominant position which the Kel Owi occupied and their
separate political organisation, further implies that they came in
considerable numbers, a conclusion which is at variance with one
set of native traditions. They could not otherwise in two hundred
years have achieved so much as they did by the beginning of the
century.</p>

<p class="cpm">THE MIGRATIONS OF THE AIR TUAREG</p>
<a href="images/map09.jpg"><img src='images/map09.jpg' alt=
''></a></figure>
</div>
<p>We know that their coming was followed by an economic
disturbance of far-reaching importance. They first occupied
North-eastern and Northern Air; the later phase of
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span> penetration
is recorded in the statement that the Kel Owi and the Kel Geres
lived side by side, west and east of the Iferuan-Auderas-Agades
road. The eastern plains of Air, according to Ahodu of Auderas and
’Umbellu of T’imia, had by this time been evacuated by the Itesan
and the early settlers, but the invasion of the Kel Owi must have
led also to the expulsion of the early settlers from the northern
marches. The removal of the Kel Ferwan from the Iferuan area, and
of the Kel Tadek from their territories north of Tamgak to the west
and the south, probably took place in this period. The Kel Owi
movement, though accompanied by frequent disturbances, was gradual.
At T’imia, where the original inhabitants, according to ’Umbellu,
were Kel Geres, they were only displaced in the time of his own
grandparents by a mixed band of settlers from various Kel Owi
tribes then living in the Ighazar in Northern Air. ’Umbellu is a
man of about sixty now, so this event may have been one hundred
years ago, at a time, in fact, when we should still expect the
southward movement of the Kel Owi to be in progress.</p>
<p>More recently still the south-eastern part of the country was
distributed among certain of their clans. The large Itesan
settlements like those near Tabello had already been abandoned and
were never again permanently inhabited; some dwellings were built
later by the Kel Owi, but never on so large a scale as in the
previous epoch. The extant houses and ruins are mostly of the first
period; a few only show a transitional phase to the later Kel Owi
type. Sometimes a compact block of contiguous buildings is to be
found, possessing the character of a fortified settlement. It would
seem that this defensible type of habitation had been evolved
during the period after the Itesan were known to have been driven
out by Tebu raiding and before the Kel Owi arrived. These dwellings
betray certain features alien to the Tuareg, which may be explained
by supposing that they were used by the serfs of the Itesan when
their lords had retreated west of the Bagezan massif.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>With the
occupation of the eastern part of Air by the Kel Owi, the ancient
caravan road which has run from time immemorial by T’intaghoda,
Unankara, Mari, Beughqot and Tergulawen fell into their hands. It
is the easiest road across the Air plateau, and perhaps for this
reason, but more probably because they always had propensities of
this sort, they developed such commercial ability that they rapidly
made for themselves a dominant place in all trade and transport
enterprises between Ghat and the Sudan. But although their
efficiency in organisation gave them the control of the road, they
certainly did not create it. But they did create a monopoly which
deprived the Kel Geres of their legitimate profit.</p>
<p>The hostilities which soon broke out between the Kel Owi and the
Kel Geres could lead to only one of two possible solutions, the
expulsion or extermination of one of the rivals. Such economic
problems are, of course, not always realised at the time when they
are most urgently felt, and the current record of events to which
they give rise is therefore often slightly distorted. Here,
however, even the popular version shows that the real cause of the
disturbances was an economic one. The Kel Owi began by
appropriating the half of a country in which they were new-comers.
They proceeded to demand the serfs and slaves whom the Kel Geres
had possessed since their subjugation of the negroid peoples of
Air. This impossible demand gave rise to considerable strife and
was referred for arbitration to the reigning Sultan of Agades. The
Hausa elements were supported by the Kel Owi for political reasons
and as far as possible abandoned their former masters. The Sultan
seems to have maintained the neutrality for which he stood, and
even to have prevented the tribes which owed allegiance to him
directly and belonged to neither party from taking sides in the
dispute.<a id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class=
"fnanchor">[407]</a> He was nevertheless unsuccessful, and after
years of desultory fighting the Kel Geres abandoned Air for Adar
and Gober to the west of Damergu and to the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_391">[391]</span> north of Sokoto. They retained their
rights in the election of the Amenokal, to whom they continued to
owe nominal allegiance through their chiefs, and were allowed to
continue to use certain Air place-names in their tribal
nomenclature. In the last century they repeatedly interfered in
choice of the Sultan, and they still consider themselves to this
day a part of the Air Tuareg, although their hostility against the
Kel Owi never died. They evacuated the country with all the slaves
and serfs whom they succeeded in retaining. It is possible that a
few of the older non-Kel Owi tribes of Air and Damergu went with
them.</p>
<p>If Barth’s date for the arrival of the Kel Owi were accepted,
this migration should have occurred in the end of the eighteenth
century. But as a matter of fact the movement took place earlier.
Jean states that an arrangement for the evacuation was reached in
the reign of the Sultan Almoubari or El Mubarak, who ruled
thirty-four years, from <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1653 to 1687.
If the agreement was made at the end of his reign, the date for the
immigration of the Kel Owi in accordance with previous information
falls in the neighbourhood of 1640, to which epoch the reign of
Sultan Muhammad Attafriya, who was deposed two years after his
accession by the Itesan, can be assigned. The Kel Geres did not,
however, leave the country directly the arrangement was made, and
in the meanwhile continued the struggle. In 1728 the Kel Owi and
the Itesan were still fighting in Air, the latter being defeated at
Abattul, near Auderas. Halfway through this century the Itesan were
fighting in the Southland and attacked Katsina in company with the
Zamfarawa. It is at this time that the Kel Geres seem to have
obtained a footing in the lands of Adar and Sokoto, though the
Itesan still refused to settle there. In 1759 there is recorded a
war between the Kel Geres and the Kel Tegama at the cliffs of
Tiggedi, in which the latter were defeated. This war was followed
by another in 1761 between the Kel Geres and the Aulimmiden, where,
however, the former suffered. In the same year the Kel
Owi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span> and the Kel
Geres fought each other at Agades. In this period the Amenokal
Muhammad Hammad, who had come to the throne in 1735, changed places
twice with Muhammad Guma, according as the Kel Owi or the Kel Geres
faction prevailed. The former, restored to the throne in 1763,
undertook an expedition with the men of Air against the King of
Gober, and was severely defeated in 1767. In order to avenge the
defeat, a truce between the warring Tuareg was finally concluded
after a century of fighting. The combined men of Air then marched
on, and defeated Dan Gudde and cut off his head. This event may be
held to mark the final settlement of the Itesan and Kel Geres in
the Southland. Their success accounts for Hornemann’s report that
at the end of the nineteenth century the Tuareg were masters of
Gober. Internecine hostilities continued, but henceforth the Itesan
and the Kel Geres are no longer described as fighting the Kel Owi
but the men of Air, as in 1780 and again in 1788, when they made
their nominee, Muhammad Dani, Sultan at Agades. In 1835 the
Amenokal, Guma, was captured in Damergu by the Kel Geres after a
massacre of the Kel Owi. It was only in about 1860 that
hostilities, which were in full progress in Barth’s day, finally
ceased.</p>
<p>Why, it may be asked, did the Itesan and not all the rest of the
pre-Kel Geres people of Air leave in consequence of the Kel Owi
invasion? The question is not easy to answer, but the surmise is
that, as the largest and most important group, they became most
involved in the struggle. With their departure and that of the Kel
Geres the remaining people became leaderless: having no
confederation of their own they clustered around the person of the
Sultan, and so came to be known as the People of the King. Yet, on
account of their ancestry and nobility, the Kel Owi sought to
attack them and arrogate to themselves the principal rôles in
history, like the story of the peace of Maket n’Ikelan and that of
the Imanen women. These claims are consistent with the
characteristic which is felt to-day in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_393">[393]</span> relations with them—the arrogance of the
parvenu. The ascendancy of the noble Itesan has continued in the
Southland as it existed in Air. They lead the Kel Geres division,
with whom fate had made them throw in their lot. They remain
primarily responsible for the choice of the Sultan even to-day.</p>
<p>Enough—too much perhaps—has been said of the three migrations of
the Tuareg people into Air. It would be tedious to continue on that
narrow subject. The complexity of the tribal organisation of the
Air Tuareg has also been made patent in the earlier attempts to
discover their social life. It is unfortunately impossible, even if
space were available, to allocate the various clans of whose
existence report has reached us to the larger groups or waves of
immigration which have been examined. Lists of the tribes which
have survived are given in <a href="#app2">Appendix II</a> to this
work: they have been arranged in such system as was feasible, using
the information collected by Barth, and Jean, and by myself. But
the classification is unsatisfactory, since there is, in many
instances, but little evidence. The organisation of the Kel Owi is,
of course, the easiest to ascertain and it was briefly outlined in
<a href="#c10">Chapter X,</a> but the People of the King are really
more interesting both because they were the earliest arrivals and
because of their association with the Itesan culture of the old
houses and deep wells. Among the People of the King the most
valuable anthropological data are to be collected. They brought
such civilisation as Nigeria possessed in the Middle Ages from the
Mediterranean, having absorbed and forgotten much of it on the way
and since those epochs.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Identification of Extant Tribes</span></h3>
<p>Before passing on to a brief summary of Central African history
as a frame into which to fit the Air migrations, I would like to
leave on record for some future student to use such conclusions as
I have been able to reach regarding the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_394">[394]</span> descendants of the first invaders of Air
recorded by Sultan Bello.</p>
<p>The geographical areas of the Kel Owi and People of the King
respectively had almost ceased to be distinguishable even before
the 1917 revolution added to the prevailing confusion. In so far as
it is at all possible to lay down broad definitions, Central and
West-central Air belonged to the People of the King, Northern,
North-eastern and Eastern Air to the Kel Owi, or People of the
Añastafidet, and Southern Air, or, as it is more properly called,
Tegama, to the servile tribes. The Talak plain was diversely
populated.</p>
<p>The first immigrants, the Immikitan, Sendal, Tamgak, Igdalen,
Ijaranen and probably Itesan, have for the most part survived in
some distinguishable form in or around Air. The survivors are all,
of course, as is to be expected, People of the King. The only
exceptions are certain nuclei which are known to have been absorbed
by the Añastafidet and his people.</p>
<p>In addition to the survivors in Air there are some Igdalen north
of Tahua, while others are Imghad of the Tarat Mellet<a id=
"FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class=
"fnanchor">[408]</a> tribe of the Ifoghas of the west. These Imghad
may have been a part of the Air group of Igdalen captured in war,
or may represent a westward emigration of a part of the stock which
came on evil days in Damergu. Generally, I regard the presence of
these Igdalen in the west as confirming Bello’s account of their
early arrival in the Air area from the east; it may also be taken
to substantiate my view that the first wave of Tuareg to the El Suk
country came from the south-east and not from the north.<a id=
"FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class=
"fnanchor">[409]</a></p>
<p>How far can the tribes which are known to exist to-day or whose
names have been recorded by modern travellers be associated with
these groups of early immigrants? A critical examination<a id=
"FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class=
"fnanchor">[410]</a> of the tribes reveals at least six
main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span> tribal groups
of the People of the King in Air itself, that is to say, six groups
in which the respective tribes either acknowledge themselves to be,
or can be shown to possess, certain affinities pointing to a
descent from single stocks; but not all of these can with certainty
be identified with Bello’s named clans. These six extant groups are
the Kel Ferwan, Kel Tadek, Immikitan, Imezegzil, Imaqoaran and
Ifadeyen.</p>
<p>Two of them, in some ways the most important, have no proper
names of their own at all: both the Kel Ferwan and Kel Tadek are
named after places, respectively Iferuan in the Ighazar of Northern
Air, and the Tadek valley. Neither of these groups, which have the
reputation of great antiquity and nobility, can be affiliated to
any of the other four groups; they are indubitably separate clans
which in the course of ages have lost their old “I names.”
Returning to the five old tribes of Bello we nevertheless find
certain points of contact between records and actual conditions, as
well as certain differences:</p>

<p>In discussing tribal origins in Air and comparing my results
with those of Jean, I found the greatest difficulty in sorting out
the tribes of the Immikitan and Imezegzil groups: so much so that I
am inclined to think that both<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_396">[396]</span> clans represent the old Immikitan stock
which split into two main branches some time ago. The widespread
use of the name Immikitan for Tuareg makes it possible that the
original stock of the People of the King was Immikitan in the first
instance; in that event, on the analogy of other Tuareg tribes,
when one clan grew unmanageable in size, new groups were formed,
only one of which retained the original nomenclature as a proper or
individual name—a process which no doubt occurred before any
migration out of the Chad area took place. But that is too far back
to consider.</p>
<p>Leaving the Ifadeyen out of account for the moment we are left
with the Kel Ferwan, the Kel Tadek and the Imaqoaran to compete for
the right of descent from the Tamgak and Sendal. A remote ancestry
is indicated by their undoubted nobility and antiquity. The
original home of the Kel Tadek in a valley flowing out of Tamgak
and the association of the Tamgak tribe with the Tamgak massif
suggest that these groups may be identified, in which case the
Sendal might be the ancestors of the Kel Ferwan. Nevertheless there
is also a possibility that the descendants of the Sendal are the
old tribes of Damergu. That the descendants of the Sendal are to be
sought for south of, rather than in Air proper, is further
indicated by the record of a war between the People of Air against
the Sendal in Elakkos as late as 1727.<a id=
"FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class=
"fnanchor">[411]</a> The Kel Ferwan, would, thus, be descended from
the Damergu-Elakkos Tuareg directly, and from the Sendal therefore
only indirectly, if their origin indeed is to be sought in this
early wave of immigration at all.</p>
<p>The selection of the Sultan of Agades being in the hands of the
tribes who traditionally sent the deputation to Constantinople
after the arrival of the Kel Geres in Air, and the object of the
mission being to settle a dispute as to who should be king, it
would be natural to find all the contestant groups represented on
the delegation. The Kel Owi would,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_397">[397]</span> of course, not figure among them, for they
had not at that time reached Air. Now the names of tribes charged
with sending the delegation is given by Jean, and I accept his
version because all the information which I procured on the subject
was very contradictory; and the list is most interesting. It is
given as: the Itesan and the Dzianara of the modern Itesan-Kel
Geres group, and the Izagaran, Ifadalen, Imaqoaran and Immikitan of
the other Tuareg. The Itesan we know about; the Dzianara were a
noble part of the Kel Geres but are now extinct: it is natural that
both these should be represented. The Izagaran and Ifadalen survive
as names of noble Damergu tribes, while the Immikitan and Imaqoaran
represent the older clans of Air proper, all four, of course, owing
allegiance to the King. From their “I names” these tribes all seem
to be old; we have no reason from any other evidence to believe
that any recent arrivals are represented in the list. The very
choice of representatives from each of three groups may
consequently be taken to indicate that these tribes were regarded
as the oldest or most important units in each division. It is
tempting, therefore, to suppose that the Izagaran and Ifadalen are
the descendants of one of the tribes in the first wave of Tuareg
which came from the south-east, and therefore perhaps of Bello’s
Sendal.</p>
<p>Another version of the method adopted to select the first
Amenokal is recorded in the Agades Chronicle, which states that the
persons responsible for the task were the Agoalla<a id=
"FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class=
"fnanchor">[412]</a> T’Sidderak, Agoalla Mafinet and Agoalla Kel
Tagei. The story relates how the Agumbulum, the title of the ruler
of the first Tuareg to enter Air, namely the Kel Innek, desired to
settle the differences which had arisen in regard to the
government, but was unable to find anyone to send to Stambul until
an old woman called Tagirit offered to send her grandsons, who were
the chieftains in question. The story emphasises what will have
been noticed on the subject of the origin of the Kel Owi, namely,
that the tribes of Air<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_398">[398]</span> generally claim a woman either as
ancestress or as a prominent head. The first two names are those of
certain Itesan sub-tribes who, from residence in these mountain
areas, which still bear the same names in Central Air, had adopted
geographical Kel names, and conserve them to this day in their
modern habitats in the Southland. The Kel Tagei is another
subdivision of the Itesan, and, though a servile tribe of this name
exists in the Imarsutan section of the Kel Owi, it is probably a
portion of the former enslaved during the later civil wars of
Air.<a id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class=
"fnanchor">[413]</a></p>
<p>This alternative story is not necessarily contradictory to the
first version of the deputation to Stambul, even though it does not
allow the remaining tribes of the People of the King to have a
share in the election. Since, however, the Itesan were certainly
the dominant tribe in Air until the arrival of the Kel Owi, the
omission is comprehensible; it is a statement of a part for the
whole. If it has any significance it tends to support the view that
the Itesan were, in fact, a tribe of the Kel Innek from the Chad
lands, as I have supposed, and not a part of the Kel Geres
group.</p>
<p>The Imaqoaran and Kel Ferwan, however, remain a difficult
problem. The latter are in many ways peculiar and seem to differ in
many ways so much from their other friends in the division of the
People of the King, that although I have no direct evidence on the
subject, I half suspect them of having come to Air from some other
part than the south-east and at a later period than the first wave.
Certain it is that they specialised in raiding westward, where they
obtained their numerous dependent Imghad. Furthermore, in Cortier’s
account of the history of the Ifoghas n’Adghar there are stories of
the formation of this western group of Tuareg tending to show that
while a part of the division probably came from the north, the bulk
of the immigration was from the east. He says that after the
Kel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> el Suk reached
the southern parts of the Sahara, they divided into two groups. The
two groups fought, and one section, which had apparently settled in
Air, was victorious, whereupon a part migrated into the Adghar,
where the other section had already established itself and had
founded the town of Tademekka. In the fighting, which continued,
there seems to have been considerable movement between the two
mountain groups; the Kel Ferwan portion of the People of the King
in Air may therefore be more nearly related to the western group
than to the other Air folk.</p>
<p>The Ifadeyen are associated with Fadé, which is the northernmost
part of the Air plateau. To-day they are very friendly with the Kel
Tadek, and some people have even suggested that they were of the
same stock. There is, however, another tribe, the Kel Fadé, the
similarity of whose name suggests, quite erroneously, an
identification. The Ifadeyen are known to be a very old tribe,
while the Kel Fadé are known to have been formed at about the time
of the arrival of the Kel Owi in Air and to have lived in the Fadé
mountains, whence the Ifadeyen were already moving south. Barth
speaks of the Kel Fadé as a collection of brigands and vagabonds,
and implies that they were mainly outlaws of mixed parentage. A
part of them is certainly Kel Owi and composed of those elements
which went on living in the northern mountains when the main body
entered Air, while another part is almost certainly Ifadeyen; as a
whole they remained outside the Kel Owi Confederation as People of
the King. Until about thirty years ago the Kel Fadé used to
maintain that the Ifadeyen were their serfs; after many disputes
the matter was referred to the paramount chief of the Kel Owi, who,
after consulting various authorities, decided that the Ifadeyen
were noble and free. Their chief, Matali, nevertheless preferred to
evacuate the northern mountains completely in favour of the Kel
Fadé in order to avoid further friction, and since then, a full
generation ago, they have been gradually moving south to the
Azawagh, where they pasture in the winter,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_400">[400]</span> withdrawing to Damergu in the dry season.
Their original history might have been easier to ascertain had it
not been for the fact that despite its “I form” their name is a
placename, though it is possible that they gave their name to Fadé
and did not take it from their habitat. The presence of the
Ifadeyen in an area west and north of country which we know the Kel
Tadek held, and their association with the latter, render it likely
that we are, in fact, dealing with one and the same stock, namely,
the descendants of the Tamgak.</p>
<p>The Ifadeyen are renowned all over Air for their pure nomadism,
and above all for the fact that they are almost the last of the
Tuareg in the Southern Sahara to retain the current use of the
T’ifingh script with a knowledge of reading and writing it. This
learning, as is usual among Imajeghan tribes, reposes with the
women-folk, one of whose principal functions is to educate the
children; it is consistent with their supposed origin as one of the
oldest and purest of all the tribes in Air.</p>
<p>As a result of the foregoing argument the following suggestions
for the main tribes of the People of the King hitherto mentioned
can be made:</p>

<p class="sch">THE HISTORY OF AIR (<em>continued</em>)</p>
<p class="sch2">Part II</p>
<p class="sch3">The Vicissitudes of the Tuareg in Air</p>
<p><span class="sc">As</span> a division of Tuareg the people of
Air cannot be said to have achieved great deeds in the history of
the world as did the Sanhaja; but as a part of the race they can
justly claim to share in its glory. That they brought culture and
the amenities of civilisation from the Mediterranean to Central
Africa has been mentioned several times. This progress in the past
was responsible for the prosperity of Nigeria to-day.</p>
<p>The People of Air are a small and insignificant group of human
beings considered by themselves alone. It may only be when that
characteristic of the Englishman displays itself and he seeks to
extol the virtues, charm and history of some obscure race, that
such a people assumes, in his eyes at least, an importance which to
the rest of the world may seem unjustified. There is probably no
race so vile, so dull or so unimpressive but that some Briton will
arise as its defender, and aver that if properly treated it is the
salt of the earth. I am not unconscious of the dangers of this
frame of mind, but being acutely aware of the mentality, I trust
that this characteristic will not have led me over-much to conceal
the unpleasant or unfavourable.</p>
<p>A chapter which attempts to deal summarily with the history of
the Air Tuareg<a id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415"
class="fnanchor">[415]</a> set in its appropriate frame of Central
African history must inevitably seem in some measure a
justification for the trouble taken to piece together<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span> an obscure and complex
collection of facts relating to the country and its people. But the
darkness surrounding the arguments contained in the preceding
account of the migrations of the Air tribes has seemed so
impenetrable that instead of closing the book at this point, I have
felt moved to give the reader some rather less indigestible matter
with which to conclude.</p>
<p>To obviate the accusation of attaching unwarrantable importance
to the People of Air, it may be well to state that the population
of the country is small. It was never very large. Perhaps 50,000 to
60,000 souls, including the Kel Geres and the other clans in the
Southland, would have been a conservative estimate in 1904. At that
time Jean, numbering only the People of Air and some of the Tuareg
of Elakkos and Damergu, arrived at a tentative figure of 25-27,000
inhabitants, but he was certainly misled by his local informants
into thinking that the tribes were smaller than they really were.
Nor did he take all the septs of Air and the Southland into
account. His estimate included somewhat over 8000 People of the
King, rather more than 8500 People of the Añastafidet, 4-5000
Irawellan, 2000 slaves and 2500-3000 mixed sedentaries in Agades
and In Gall.<a id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class=
"fnanchor">[416]</a> At the time of the prosperity of Agades the
population of these countries, not including detached sedentaries
and other groups lying far afield, may have attained a maximum of
100,000.</p>
<p>It is impossible to estimate the total numbers of Tuareg in
North Africa with any accuracy. It would be interesting to make a
serious study of the numbers and general state even of those in
French territories.</p>
<p>The internecine struggles of the Air Tuareg are hardly
interesting, and have only been mentioned where relevant to the
origin and movements of the three immigrations. The wars between
the different divisions, like the Ahaggaren and the Azger, are not
really more valuable in a general survey. But even to summarise the
principal events in Air<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_403">[403]</span> in the broad outlines is easier than to
describe in a few words the events which took place in the Central
Sahara and the Central Sudan during the 1000 years of history which
have elapsed since first, in my view at least, the Tuareg reached
these mountains from their more ancient northern home.</p>
<p>In early times the Tuareg were already in North Africa. They can
be distinguished probably as early as the Fifth, and certainly as
early as the Twelfth, Dynasty in Egypt. We can follow much of what
they were doing and trace where they were living in Roman times,
but it is less easy to discern the groups which composed the
immigrant waves of humanity into Air until about the time when the
first of them came to the south, and even then the picture is
obscure.</p>
<p>When Air was first invaded by the Tuareg it was called Asben and
was part of the kingdom of Gober, a country of negroid people who
lived both in the mountains and to the south. But before the first
invasion took place there was already Libyan influence in the
country, both due to the northern trade which had gone on since the
earliest times conceivable, and also on account of the Sanhaja
Tuareg, whose power and glory had extended thus far eastwards.</p>
<p>The first invasion consisted of tribes who had formed part of a
mass of Tuareg of the Lemta division originally from, and now still
settled in, the Fezzan and Ghat areas. These people had descended
the Kawar road to Lake Chad. They had occupied Bornu, perhaps in
the early ninth century <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>, or even
before. The Goberawa of Air or Asben seem to have received a slight
admixture of Libyan blood derived from the northerners who
travelled down the caravan road to the Sudan; the people of Bornu
were more purely negroid, and more so than their northern
neighbours and probably kinsfolk, the Tebu of Tibesti. The Tuareg
who were settled in Bornu were subjected to pressure from the east
and north, at the hands of the Kanuri from east of Lake Chad, and
of the Arabs. In due course, after being kings<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_404">[404]</span> of Bornu for many generations the Tuareg
began to move westwards. Some of them reached Air, leaving
settlers, or having previously settled the regions of Elakkos and
Damergu. The date of this movement cannot be fixed with any
accuracy; it is probably not as early at the eighth century, but is
certainly anterior to the great Kanuri expansion of the thirteenth
century. An early date is suggested by Barth and accepted by Jean,
probably merely on account of the incidence of the first Arab
invasion of North Africa, though as a matter of fact the forces of
Islam for the sixty years which elapsed after the conquest of Egypt
were not really sufficiently numerous to occasion great ethnic
movements. The six centuries between <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
700 and <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1300 are very obscure; but if
any reason must be assigned for the first invasion of Air by the
Bornu Tuareg, it was probably due to the Hillalian invasion of
Africa. For this and other reasons it may, therefore, be placed in
the eleventh century.</p>
<p>With the opening of the Muhammadan era we find a kingdom at
Ghana in Western Negroland with a ruling family of “white people”
and the Libyan dynasty of Za Alayamin (Za el Yemani) installed at
Kukia.<a id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class=
"fnanchor">[417]</a> Gao, on the Niger, was already an important
commercial centre at the southern end of the trade road from
Algeria. In <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 837 we read of the death
of Tilutan, a Tuareg of the Lemtuna,<a id=
"FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class=
"fnanchor">[418]</a> who was very powerful in the Sahara; he was
succeeded by Ilettan, who died in 900; the latter was followed by
T’in Yerutan as lord of the Western Sahara. He was established at
Audaghost,<a id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class=
"fnanchor">[419]</a> an outpost of the Sanhaja, who appear at this
time to have dominated Western Negroland, including<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span> even the great city of
Ghana,<a id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class=
"fnanchor">[420]</a> and to have carried on active intercourse
between the Southland and Sijilmasa in Morocco. This and the
succeeding century are notable for the influence of the Libyan
tribes, in the first instance through the Libyan kings of
Audaghost, and later, at the beginning of the eleventh century, by
the desert confederation which Abu Abdallah, called Naresht, the
son of Tifaut, had brought into being. It was at this time that the
preacher and reformer, Abdallah ibn Yasin, arose and collected in
the Sahara his band of Holy Men called the “Merabtin,” who were
destined to play such a large rôle in the history of the world
under the name of Almoravid in Morocco and in Spain. Throughout the
latter part of the eleventh century and in the whole of the
twelfth, the really important element in all the Western Sahara and
Sudan was the Sanhaja division of the Tuareg of the west, and
though nothing is heard of the effects of their rule on Air, they
must nevertheless have been considerable. The Mesufa branch of the
Sanhaja were, according to Ibn Batutah, established in Gober, south
of Air; the influence of the Sanhaja in Air itself as well as in
Damergu is also recorded. West of Air was the city of Tademekka,
nine days northwards from Gao. We also hear of the Libyan towns of
Tirekka, between the Tademekka and Walata, and Tautek six days
beyond Tirekka; all these appear to have sprung up under the
Sanhaja dominion as commercial centres in the same way as the later
city of Timbuctoo. Agades, at this time, had not yet been
founded.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the thirteenth or end of the twelfth century
the second invasion of Air took place. Until now the Tuareg
immigrants had lived side by side with the Goberawa despite the
assistance which the former must have derived from the Sanhaja
influence in the land. The new invaders were the Kel Geres, and
their advent led to the expulsion or absorption of the negroid
people. Together with the former inhabitants and under the
leadership of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
dominant Itesan tribe, the Tuareg consolidated their independence
in Air. This might never have been achieved had it not been for the
Sanhaja empire in the west; there is no doubt that the success of
the latter contributed directly to the Bornu and Air movements.</p>
<p>By the time Ibn Batutah made his journey through Negroland in
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1353, Tekadda, some days south of the
mountains, as well as Air itself were wholly Tuareg.</p>
<p>Between Gao and Tekadda he had journeyed through the land of the
“Bardamah, a nomad Berber tribe,”<a id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> whose tents and dietary
are described in a manner which makes it clear that we are dealing
with typical nomadic Tuareg. The Bardamah women, incidentally, are
said to have been very beautiful and to have been endowed with that
particular fatness which so struck Barth. At Tekadda the Sultan was
a “Berber” (Libyan) called Izar.<a id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> There was also another
prince of the same race called “the Tekerkeri,” though further on
Ibn Batutah refers to him somewhat differently, saying, “We arrived
in Kahir, which is part of the domains of the Sultan Kerkeri.” From
this Barth deduces that the name of the ruler’s kingdom, which
included Air but apparently not Tekadda, was “Kerker,” but we have
seen that the chief minister of the Sultan of the Tuareg is called
the Kokoi Geregeri, and it is to this title that I think Ibn
Batutah is referring. Nevertheless, as a branch of the Aulimmiden
in the west is also called Takarkari, this may signify that the
plateau was at this period under the influence of those western
Tuareg who have in history often exerted a preponderating part in
the history of Southern Air.</p>
<p>The expansion of Bornu under Dunama II in the thirteenth century
had, in the course of the conquest of the Fezzan, brought about the
occupation of Kawar and other points on the Murzuk-Chad road. This
could not but have had a serious effect on the economics of Air on
account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span> of the
Bilma salt trade, and there is a tradition of a war with Bornu in
about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1300. Raiding on a large scale
across the desert no doubt also took place. By the middle of the
fourteenth century, however, the greatness of Bornu had commenced
to decline; the reigning dynasty was suffering severely at the
hands of the “Sô people,” who were the original pagan inhabitants
of the country. They had succeeded in defeating and killing four
successive Kanuri rulers, and only twenty years after Ibn Batutah’s
journey there were sown in the reign of Daud the germs of that
internal strife which led to the complete expulsion of the Bornu
dynasty from Kanem and continuous warfare between these two
countries.</p>
<p>In the west, on the other hand, the power of the empire of Melle
was still, if not quite at its height, at least unmenaced by any
serious rival. With the death of Ibn Ghania in <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 1233 the Sanhaja Confederation had come to an
end. There then arose on the Upper Niger a leader called Mari Jatah
I. After making himself master of two of the greatest negroid
peoples of the west, he was succeeded by Mansa Musa, the founder of
the empire of Melle. Mansa Musa, or, as he was also called, Mansa
Kunkur Musa, after adding to his dominions all the famous countries
of Western Sudan, turned eastwards and conquered Gao, on the Middle
Niger. He also subjected Timbuctoo, which had been founded about
the year <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1000 by the Tuareg of the
Idenan and Immedideren tribes during the Sanhaja period, but its
conquest only served to increase its prosperity as a trading
centre. It was visited and inhabited by merchants from all over
North Africa.</p>
<p>It is interesting, in considering the history of Melle, to
observe an attempt which was made at this early period, in a
country so long considered by Europeans as savage and barbarous, to
solve a problem of government on more rational lines than has ever
been tried in modern Europe. A dual system of administration was
organised to deal with races foreign to the authority of the
central government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
There was a national and a territorial bureaucracy: the feature of
the government was that Melle was divided territorially into two
provinces, or vice-royalties, concurrently with which there were
three separate ethnic or national administrations. It almost goes
without saying that the military administration was kept strictly
apart from the civil.</p>
<p>With the death of Mansa Musa and the succession of his son Mansa
Magha, in 1331, the fabric of the empire began to fall in pieces.
Timbuctoo had been successfully attacked in 1329 by the King of
Mosi, who expelled the Melle garrison. A little later the prince,
Ali Killun, son of Za Yasebi, of the original Songhai dynasty of
Gao, escaped with his brother from the court of Mansa Magha, where
they had been living as political prisoners in the guise of pages.
They acquired some measure of independence and, though again
subjected by the succeeding king of Melle, Mansa Suleiman, in about
1336 commenced to lay the foundations of the later Songhai empire
on the Middle Niger. Mansa Suleiman recaptured Timbuctoo, which at
this time, inhabited by the Mesufa, had begun to take the place of
the older Tuareg centre, Tademekka, further east. The Mesufa, whom
we last saw south of Air, were doubtless being pushed back west
again by the pressure of the Aulimmiden and migrants from the
East.</p>
<p>In 1373 the Vizier of Melle, another Mari Jatah, usurped the
power from the grandson of Mansa Magha and reconquered Tekadda, but
it was the last flicker of life in the old empire. The opening
years of the fourteenth century saw a succession of weak kings and
powerful governors who were not strong enough to resist the
incursions of the Tuareg from the desert. Timbuctoo was conquered
in 1433 from the Mesufa by some other Tuareg, probably from the
west or north-west, under Akil (Ag Malwal), who declined to abandon
his nomadic life and installed as governor Muhammad Nasr el Senhaji
from Shingit in Mauretania. The Tuareg at this time were everywhere
victorious but destructive.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_409">[409]</span> They never succeeded in consolidating their
power into an empire. In this era of their ascendancy Agades was
founded in about the year 1460, just as Sunni Ali, the son of Sunni
Muhammad Dau, ascended the throne of Gao and changed the whole
political map of North Africa by prostrating the small surviving
kingdom of Melle and finally setting up in its place the Songhai
empire.</p>
<p>The incessant bickering and local feuds had driven the Tuareg of
Air to come to some arrangement by which, nominally at least, they
could consolidate themselves against the powers of the Sudan. They
had agreed to have a Sultan, and he was installed, and not long
afterwards the Amenokalate was set up in Agades, at a most eventful
period in Central African history. The empire of Songhai on the
Niger seemed invincible. By 1468 Timbuctoo had been overwhelmed and
the governor driven out; Akil, the Tuareg, was forced to flee
westwards. The city was plundered and the occupation of Western
Negroland commenced. In the meanwhile the Portuguese had planted
the factory of Elmina on the Guinea coast, and Alfonso V was
succeeded by João II, who sent an embassy to Sunni Ali.</p>
<p>Sunni Ali met his death by drowning in 1492, and was followed by
his son Abu Bakr Dau, and at a short interval by Muhammad ben Abu
Bakr, called Muhammad Askia, the greatest of all the kings of the
Sudan, and one of the greatest monarchs in the world of the
fifteenth century. He appears to have ruled with great wisdom,
depending on careful administration rather than on force to
maintain his prestige. In addition to Melle itself and Jenne, which
had already fallen, Ghana and Mosi in the far west were added to
Songhai. After a pilgrimage of great pomp across Africa and through
Egypt, Haj Muhammad Askia turned his attentions to the east.
Katsina was occupied in 1513 as well as the whole of Gober and the
rest of Hausaland. It was inevitable, to stop the Tuareg raiding
down in the settled country, that Air should be added to his
dominion as well.</p>
<p>In 1515 Askia marched against Al Adalet, or Adil,
one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> of the twin
co-Sultans of Agades, and drove out the Tuareg tribes living in the
town,<a id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class=
"fnanchor">[423]</a> replacing them with his own Songhai people, a
colonisation from which the city has not recovered to this day. He
remained in occupation a year, and was called the “Cursed.” The
conquest is unfortunately not mentioned by Leo,<a id=
"FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class=
"fnanchor">[424]</a> who only refers to the expedition against Kano
and Katsina; and this is all the more unpardonable, for he had
accompanied his uncle on an official visit to Askia himself. Leo
clearly regards Agades at the time he was writing as a negro
settlement. According to traditions current in the city, numbers of
Tuareg were massacred by Askia’s men, but however many Songhai may
have been planted there, and however many Tuareg expelled, there is
no doubt that considerable numbers remained behind to mix with the
southerners and form the present Emagadesi people. The town must
have been in a very flourishing state at that time: “the greatest
part of the citizens are forren merchants” who paid “. . . large
custom to the king . . . on their merchandise out of other places.”
But apart from the yearly tribute of 150,000 ducats due to the King
of Gao, the conquest of Air does not seem to have affected the
independence of the Tuareg, as no mention is made of a Songhai
governor, while the King of Agades, already within a few years of
the time of Leo’s journey, is reported to have kept a military
force of his own.</p>
<p>The contemporaries of Askia in Kanem and Bornu were Ali, the son
of another Dunama, and later, Ali’s son, Idris, both kings of such
renown that their country appears on European maps as early as
1489. Not to be outdone by the Songhai kings, whose emissaries had
reached Portugal, Idris sent an embassy to Tripoli in 1512. Under
the son of Idris, Muhammad, who ruled from 1526 to 1545, the
kingdom of Bornu reached the summit of its greatness. This
remarkable century in Central Africa deserves examination in
greater detail, but lack of space makes it impossible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>Agades was
perhaps at the height of its prosperity before and immediately
after the conquest of Muhammad Askia. The scale of life in which
Air shared is shown by the description of Muhammad Askia’s
pilgrimage in 1495. He was accompanied by 1000 men on foot and 500
on horseback, and in the course of which he spent 300,100 mithkal
of gold. The prosperity of Agades continued until the commencement
of the nineteenth century, but in a form far different from what it
must have been in the sixteenth century, when it served as an
advanced trading-post or entrepôt for Gao, at that time the centre
of the gold trade of the Sudan and probably the most flourishing
commercial city in Central Africa. The gradual desertion of Agades,
almost complete by 1790, when the bulk of the population migrated
to Katsina, Tasawa, Maradi and Kano, commenced in 1591, at which
date Gao, the parent city from the commercial point of view, had
fallen to be a province of the Moroccan empire.</p>
<p>The heritage of Muhammad Askia was beyond the power of his
successors to maintain. Intestine wars and intrigues broke down the
authority of the central government. Revolts took place in Melle,
and the covetous eyes of Mulai Ahmed, the Sultan of Morocco, in
1549, were turned towards Negroland. He demanded the cession of the
Tegaza salt-mines, and though this insult was avenged by an army of
2000 Tuareg invading Morocco in 1586, Tegaza was captured by the
Moors soon afterwards and the deposits of Taodenit, north of
Timbuctoo, were opened instead. The final blow fell three years
later, when Gao was entered by Basha Jodar, the eunuch-general of
Mulai Hamed, with a Moroccan army. The final struggles of Ishak
Askia in 1591 were unavailing. Henceforth Moroccan governors
reigned over the Western Sudan with garrisons in Jenne, Timbuctoo,
Gao and elsewhere. In 1603 Mulai Hamed el Mansur of Morocco died,
with the whole of Western Africa under his rule.</p>
<p>Power in the west thus passed once more from the
negroid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span> to the
northern people, but traditions of empire persisted in the centre.
In 1571 there came to the throne of Bornu, Idris Ansami, known more
usually from the place of his burial as Idris Alawoma. His mother
seems from her name—’Aisha-Kel Eghrarmar—to have been a Tuareg; she
had the reputation of great beauty. After consolidating his empire
to the east, Idris conquered Hausaland as far west as and including
Kano, where he must have come into contact with the Songhai empire,
just then in process of passing under the rule of Morocco. So Idris
Alawoma<a id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class=
"fnanchor">[425]</a> turned his attention to the north-west, and
undertook three expeditions against the Tuareg, the last one of
which was against Air itself, the first two presumably being
against more southern tribes. The chronicle of Idris’ expeditions
is not clear enough to identify the exact areas of his operations.
The first one was described as a raid, and the second, an
expedition against a tribe. The operations against Air started from
Atrebisa and passed Ghamarama, doubtfully identified with Gamram in
Northern Damergu, after which a host of Tuareg was overtaken in the
open desert between the town, Tadsa, and Air, and many were
slaughtered. Idris returned to Munio by way of Zibduwa and
Susubaki. At an earlier date than these expeditions his vizier had
fought a battle with the Tuareg, who had come with a numerous host
of Tildhin (?)<a id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426"
class="fnanchor">[426]</a> and others to attack him at Aghalwen,
which is Eghalgawen in Southern Air, on the road to the
Southland.</p>
<p>Having broken the power of the Air Tuareg, Idris Alawoma ordered
the Kel Yiti, or Kel Wati, who were living in his dominions, to
raid north and north-west in order to keep the tribes in a properly
chastened frame of mind, until they were obliged to sue for peace
and acknowledge their allegiance to the kingdom of Bornu. Barth
thinks the Kel Wati are to be identified with the Kel Eti, or
Jokto,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> a mixed Tebu
and Tuareg people in the parts near Lake Chad. This is probably the
period of raids in South-eastern Air, previously referred to, which
obliged the Itesan to abandon their eastern settlements and move
west into the heart of the mountains. The supposition is borne out
by the record of Idris’ expedition against the Tebu of Dirki and
Agram, or Fashi, which was followed by a long stay at Bilma and the
opening up of relations with the north. All these events fall into
the first twelve years of Idris Alawoma’s reign: of the last
twenty-one we know little.</p>
<p>In 1601 at Agades, Muhammad ben Mubarak ibn el Guddala, or
Ghodala, deposed the Amenokal Yussif ben el Haj Ahmed ibn el Haj
Abeshan, and reigned in his stead for four months. Yussif
recaptured the power and ben Mubarak fled to Katsina and Kano, but
returning to Air entered Agades with a body of men from Bornu. He
went on to Assode, and then retired within a short time to Gamram
in Damergu. Yussif in the meanwhile had collected men in the
Southland of Kebbi and returned to the charge. Ben Mubarak again
fled to Bornu, but was later captured, and died in prison. This
period of hostility between Air and Bornu led Idris Alawoma’s
grandson Ali ben el Haj Omar ben Idris to wage several wars against
the Sultan of Agades, though he was once himself besieged in his
own capital by the Tuareg and their allies. To the wars in this
reign, lasting from 1645 to 1684 or 1685, belong the events which
Jean has recorded incorrectly as occurring in 1300,<a id=
"FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class=
"fnanchor">[427]</a> in the reign of the eighth Sultan before
Lamini.<a id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class=
"fnanchor">[428]</a> The latter is, of course, the famous Muhammad
el Amin el Kanemi of Denham and Clapperton’s expedition, who was,
in fact, the eighth Sultan before Ali ben Idris.</p>
<p>Tradition in Air and the Agades Chronicle at this point agree
tolerably well with the Bornu Chronicle. The Bornu king laid siege
to Agades, where Muhammad Mubaraki (1653-87) was reigning, and
defeated the Tuareg, who,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_414">[414]</span> after a number of engagements in the Telwa
valley, retired to the fastness of Bagezan. Their resources enabled
them to hold out for three years against the Bornuwi forces, who
were starving in the lowlands. The war of 1685 is called in the
Agades Chronicle the War of Famine. The people of Bornu eventually
withdrew eastwards over the desert, hotly pursued by the Tuareg all
the way to the well of Ashegur, north of Fashi, which, as will be
remembered, had previously been occupied by Idris Alawoma. Deserted
by their Sultan, the Bornuwi were surprised, and left 300-400
prisoners in the hands of the Tuareg, who, from now on to the
present day, have exercised a paramount influence over these oases,
where they developed the salt trade with the Sudan<a id=
"FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class=
"fnanchor">[429]</a> through Air. The gold trade of Songhai, at one
time so important in Agades that it had its own standard weight for
the metal, which long after its disappearance continued to regulate
the circulating medium of exchange, was replaced by the salt
traffic as an asset of much value.<a id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>
<p>The campaigns of Idris Alawoma and of Ali repeated the effects
of the earlier Kanuri pressure on the west. Evidence of the
tendency of the southern Tuareg to move west has been noticed on
several occasions. The effect of the Bornu campaigns was to exert
pressure on the Aulimmiden, which culminated in their attacks on
the Tademekkat people and eventually in the Kel Owi immigration
into Air. The sequence of events in Air has already been related;
the successes of the Aulimmiden contributed directly and indirectly
to the decline of Agades as a commercial centre. By 1770 they had
captured Gao. Under Kawa, in 1780, they established a dominion over
the north bank of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_415">[415]</span> Niger at Ausa; these were doubtless some
factors which influenced the Kel Geres in their decision to abandon
Air as a result of the arrival of the Kel Owi. The westward move of
the Aulimmiden before the Kanuri of Bornu, who were suffering from
the reaction which follows greatness, had left an area
correspondingly free for the Kel Geres to occupy. The middle of the
century had been taken up in desultory fighting between Air and the
south. The next notable event had been in 1761—an attack on Kano by
the Kel Owi and the defeat of the Kel Geres by the Aulimmiden in
the same year. The inroads of the Fulani into Hausaland had
commenced, but as yet Othman dan Fodio had not established himself
in Sokoto, or the ruling families of Fulani in all the large towns
of the Central Sudan.</p>

<p>The protection of the salt trade led to continual struggles
between Air and Bornu. An expedition by the Sultan of Agades, in
about 1760,<a id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class=
"fnanchor">[431]</a> to Kuka on Lake Chad is probably part of the
war of Bilma in 1759 referred to in the Agades Chronicle as having
been made by Muhammad Guma, the son of Mubarak. The Sultan was
accompanied by the Kel Ferwan, and returned with a war indemnity of

to interference.</p>
<p>The occupation of part of Damergu by the Kel Owi Tuareg is of
course recent, though it had been seized by the earlier immigrants
at the same time as Air, with this difference, that the negroid
inhabitants were never driven out or absorbed as in the mountains.
The Kel Owi interference and immigration took the form of
successful raiding or warfare to keep open the caravan road into
the south. The fate of Damergu in all this long period of history
was to be squeezed between the Tuareg on two sides and the Sudan
empires on the other two.<a id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href=

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>The modern
period commences with the passage through Air of the Foureau-Lamy
Mission. Beyond what has already been said, it is impossible to
discuss this phase, as it is still too recent, but the French
version is contained in Lieut. Jean’s admirable review of French
colonial policy in the <em>Territoires du Niger</em>.</p>

"c14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p class="sch">VALEDICTORY</p>
<p><span class="sc">Here</span> my account of the Air Tuareg must
close. No one can be better aware than myself of the shortcomings
and discrepancies of my story. The task would have been easier had
a general survey of an unprejudiced character of the history and
ethnology of North Africa existed. Where my account has wandered
from the field of the Tuareg of Air, it has had to build both a
general and a particular foundation for itself, and I am conscious
that the result is not as satisfactory as it should be. The
subjects of script and of language have scarcely been touched upon
at all; they are too large and specialised matters for this volume.
If ever there should come a period of leisure for me, they might be
made the subject of a separate study.</p>
<p>I cannot conceal the pleasure that writing this account has
afforded me in the course of my researches, by making the scenes
which I enjoyed in Air live again before my eyes. Had the time
available both in Africa and since my return been commensurate with
my interest in the subject, the result would have been better.
Intended originally as a book of travel, it has in places become
complicated, obscure and overladen with some of the fruits of
inquiry in a vast field, namely, the origin and nature of all the
peoples of North Africa. I shall feel amply rewarded if another
student will allow his curiosity to be sufficiently stimulated to
continue the work.</p>
<p>As the writer of a book of travel I must complete the tale of
the journey. I came to an end of my wanderings where I had begun
them, in Northern Nigeria. My two friends and I had started from
there on 27th April, 1922; I returned there alone on the 29th
December of the same<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_418">[418]</span> year. After my tour in Northern Air it
became apparent that the time at my disposal must prove too short
to achieve the object of crossing the Sahara to the Mediterranean
with my companions. At Iferuan I regretfully decided to return home
by way of Nigeria. At the commencement of December I turned south
and marched to Agellal, a large village of stone houses under a
singularly beautiful mountain. From there I went to Tefis to see
the mosque, and camped at Anu Wisheran, which means “The Old Well.”
There were small deserted settlements at both places. After another
camp at Garet I descended into the basin of Central Air, over a
barren slope intersected by numerous north and south rivulets
between bare stony ridges. I halted in the Anu Maqaran valley near
the boulder on which I discovered the chariot drawing. The site of
my camp had been purely adventitious, but that obscure rock may
well prove to be the most important observation of my whole
journey. On the following day, Bila was reached at the spur of the
Azamkoran mountains, and then we passed by the sugar-loaf hill of
Sampfotchi into the Arwa Mellen and familiar Assada valleys. After
a long march from the Tamenzaret wells I came again to Auderas,
where I rejoined my companions, but only for a day or two, to sort
our belongings and part company, I to return south, they to go on
north and after many tedious delays to reach Algiers. The pleasant
people of Auderas came to say good-bye. My companions walked a mile
or so along my road, over the valley and hill, till we reached the
plain sloping down to Taruaji. There they turned back. With me were
only Sidi my guide, Amadu my servant, and one camel boy. Sidi had
not been to Nigeria for many years and I was anxious for him to see
modern Kano. We travelled fast, stopping only one day on the way in
order to try to save a camel which had caught pneumonia during the
bitterly cold nights in Azawagh. We went by Inwatza, the pool of
Tizraet near Turayet, Akaraq, Eghalgawen, Milen, Hannekar and
Tanut, and then straight into Nigeria without going to Zinder.
On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> 29th December,
the thirty-third day after leaving Iferuan, I reached Kano again
after a journey of some 550 miles in twenty-nine marches. Even the
Tuareg admitted that it was fast travelling. The camels arrived
very fit indeed and were sold. A fortnight later I was embarking at
Lagos for England.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>My guide, Sidi, was astonished at the prosperity and development
of Kano. I gave him some small presents and a few things to take
back to Ahodu of Auderas. He left Kano before I did, as he had
found a caravan returning north and did not want to miss the
opportunity of travelling with friends. He came to see me in the
morning of the day he was due to leave, and we walked round the
European quarter of Kano together. I happened to be with a French
officer at the time. We met Sidi waiting where I had told him to
be, under a certain tree in front of a well-known merchant’s store
in the European town of Kano. Sidi got up and greeted me. His hand
and mine brushed over one another’s, the fingers being withdrawn
with a closing snap. I gave him the usual greeting: “Ma’-tt-uli,”
and he replied very solemnly, “El Kheir ’Ras”; which mean, “How do
you fare?” and “Naught but good.” When Tuareg meet these
hand-clasps and greetings continue to punctuate their conversation
for a long time. They are varied with the question, “Iselan?”
meaning, “What news?” to which the right answer is, “Kalá, kalá,”
“No, no!” since for them any news must be bad news. Then, as I have
said, Sidi and I and the Frenchman walked together; the latter
looked wonderingly at the demeanour of my friend, whom he did not
know. At last it was time for Sidi to join the camels of his
caravan. Their number had been increased by one camel which I had
given to him. He turned to say good-bye, but did not speak at all.
He took my hand and held it with both of his, and then bowed his
forehead till his veil touched my fingers. I gave him the thanks of
the Lord in Arabic, and he murmured something incomprehensible. My
French friend looked on curiously. And<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_420">[420]</span> then Sidi without glancing at him turned
quickly and walked away like a Prince of the Earth striding over
the land. He walked erect and swiftly till I lost him to sight. He
never turned his head again.</p>
<p>He was in many ways rather a ruffian, but, like his folk,
patient, long-suffering and unforgiving. He was a true specimen of
the Tuareg race.</p>
<p>These people never become angry or speak loud: I have rarely
seen them excited, but they have an indomitable spirit and for that
reason will perhaps survive. They say, “Kiss the hand you cannot
cut off,” and again, “The path, though it be winding, and the King,
though he be old.” So they may have patience after all to wait for
the fulfilment of their fate and not throw themselves fruitlessly
again on rifles or machine-guns. I remember sitting at Gamram one
evening on the ruins of the walls of the town where once their
rulers lived as wardens of the marches of the desert on that great
Saharan road. In my diary I wrote:</p>
<p>“Last night I sat on the old walls looking west towards the
yellow sunset under a blue-black cloud of rain hanging low in the
sky. A man had lit a fire which smoked very much, and the west wind
was carrying the smoke away over the wall in a horizontal streak
between me and the sunset. They have gone, the Tuareg, from history
like that streak of smoke. Even the Almoravids are only a name. I
wonder why. They have fought with a losing hand so long. They were
driven down from the north by the Arabs and by Europe, and harried
by everyone. They have also harried others well. Finally, the
French have come and have occupied their country. For long it was
thought that the Tuareg would be untamable. They fought well and
hard. The fire of old remained. In Air it broke again into flame in
1917 with Kaossen’s revolt, but in the end the force of European
arms prevailed. The French killed many and punished the people of
Air very hardly, too hardly as some of their own officers think, in
dealing with a people<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_421">[421]</span> which is already so small and tending to
die out. But though calm and peaceful to-day like the smoke carried
away from the fire by the walls of Gamram, the point of flame
remains. I could see the heart of the fire from which the smoke was
coming. I wonder if the flame will burst forth again. You have
fought well, you people. You would not bow your necks, so they have
been broken, but perhaps your day may come again. It grew dark on
the walls of Gamram and the sunset of rain faded away; the fire
continued to burn, but my thoughts turned elsewhere, to my journey,
to my riding camel (wondering whether it would survive: I gave it
some millet that night as extra fodder), to England, and to what I
should have to eat there. I had an omelette which I made myself,
and some fresh milk for supper that evening. Thence my thoughts
turned to other things as well. . . .”</p>
<p>And here it is better that I close. It is on the knees of the
gods how they achieve their destiny. I hope that the gods will be
good to them.</p>
<p>They were my very good friends, and I was very pleased to live
with them, for they were very agreeable. Perhaps we shall meet
again and travel together once more. And so their proverb, which
has seemed to me very true, will be fulfilled for them and for me.

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span><a id=
"app1"></a>APPENDIX I</h2>
<p class="sch">A LIST OF THE ASTRONOMICALLY DETERMINED POINTS IN
AIR</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> positions given in the following
table have been collected from the record of the proceedings of the
Foureau-Lamy Mission, from the list given on the second sheet of
the “Carte de l’Air” prepared by the Mission Cortier and others on
a scale of 1/500,000, and from the observations by the author. Two
positions given in Lieut. Jean’s <em>Les Touareg du Sud-Est</em>
are also included. The French longitudes have been converted into
longitudes east of Greenwich by the addition 2° 20′ 14″.</p>
<p>The author’s observations were carried out with a three-inch
transit theodolite by Cary and Porter, and were in all cases
stellar sights. The latitudes were in all cases determined from
pairs of north and south circum-meridian stars, or from altitudes
of Polaris and one south star. The longitudes were determined by
calculations based on local mean time derived from pairs of east
and west stars, and chronometric differences from points which had
previously been determined by French travellers. Where the author’s
longitudes for points previously determined by French observers are
also given, they are the result of chronometric differences from
other points previously or successively visited. The author,
however, has not used his own longitudes for determining
intermediate points when French observations were available, and
his co-ordinates in these instances are only reproduced for
purposes of comparison.</p>
<p>The data for the Foureau-Lamy observations are described in the
record of the proceedings of the expedition. The source of the
positions given on the Cortier map is not stated. The data for
Colonel Tilho’s positions are in the record of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_423">[423]</span> the delimitation of the northern
boundary of Nigeria. The author’s computations are in the records
of the Royal Geographical Society in London, where are also the
original route reports and prismatic compass traverses made
throughout the journey.</p>
<p>Where possible the author’s chronometric differences were
checked by opening and closing a series of observations on points
previously fixed by French observers. In one unfortunate case,
however, the author’s watches stopped as a result of his camels
going astray and the series was consequently broken. His watches
again stopped at Auderas, where, however, he stayed a sufficient
length of time to re-rate them. At this place a number of local
mean time observations were taken over a long period.</p>
<p>The author’s longitude observations were carried out as

the site of the French post and therefore also of the rest-house
where the Cortier observation was taken, differs so materially from
the latter that it cannot be accepted. It is described (like the
position he gives for Iferuan) as “d’après F. Foureau,” but I can
find no record in the account of the proceedings of the
Foureau-Lamy Mission to justify this statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_436"></a><a href="#FNanchor_436"><span class=

yards east of the camp site which the Foureau-Lamy Mission occupied
and where, therefore, Foureau’s observation was probably made. This
difference accounts for the discrepancy in our longitudes. The
Cortier map shows an astronomically fixed point at Auderas which,
when measured on the copy in my possession, gives these
co-ordinates, but they are not recorded in the table on the second
sheet of the map, as are the other positions in Air. Foureau’s
latitude is based upon five observations, one of which is
appreciably smaller than the other four; if this result is omitted
from the average, the latitude becomes even higher than it is given
in the table.</p>

<p class="space-above15">The work of Barth and Jean has been
incorporated in these tables; further reference to these authors is
therefore omitted. Alternative name forms from these and other
sources are given in brackets below the spelling which has been
adopted to conform as far as possible with the rules of the Royal
Geographical Society’s Committee on names.</p>
<p>(N) and (S) respectively signify “noble” and “servile”
tribes.</p>
<p>In many cases no territorial identification is given, as tribes
have changed their areas very greatly since 1917-18, nor have they
settled down permanently to occupy other ranges since then. When
Northern Air was cleared by the French patrols, the tribes were
moved south, and for the most part they are therefore now in the
neighbourhood of Agades, or in the Azawagh or even further south.
But they are arranged in a disorderly fashion and are always moving
from place to place; any attempt to give their present areas would
be fruitless, since they will probably prove to be only temporary.
The process of returning north had already commenced in 1922 and
has presumably continued since then. Such locations as are given in
the tables refer to periods prior to 1917 unless the contrary is
stated.</p>
<p>The left-hand column gives the name of the original tribal stock
so far as it has been possible to trace one. The next column gives
the names of the tribes and sub-tribes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_427">[427]</span> formed by the original group. It is often
impossible to state for certain whether large tribes are still to
be described as such, or whether they have become independent
tribes with subsidiary clans. Thus the whole classification must be
considered approximate. It is designed to carry one stage further
the system commenced by Barth, and continued by Jean. Where these
two authorities are stated to have made mistakes or to have been
inaccurate, the brevity of such phrases, occasioned as it has been
by the use of a tabular form of arrangement, does not denote more
than an expression of different opinion. It is intended to convey
no disparagement, but merely to obviate circumlocution. The remarks
in the right-hand column are intended to be read in conjunction
with the relevant parts of the text of this book to which they are
supplementary.</p>

<p><span class="sc">North</span> of Gure the hills terminate
suddenly in a cliff, and the area called Elakkos begins to the
north of them. It has an individuality of its very own. A maze of
small, closed depressions, that become ponds and lakes after the
rainy season, break up the plain into sharp unsystematic
undulations, which appear originally to have been sand dunes. They
have now become fixed with grass and scanty scrub, but in most
cases retain their characteristic shape. Here and there, rising
several hundred feet above the plain, are a number of flat-topped
hills of red sandstone. They stand alone like islands off a
rock-bound coast. The edges of the hills are sheer cliffs, but the
lower parts are covered with fallen detritus, which has formed
steep slopes above the plain, and the wind has washed the sand up
against their sides.</p>
<p>The plain of Elakkos is like a sea floor from which the water
has only recently run off. An irregular sand-strewn bottom has been
left, churned up by immense waves that, in a succession of cyclonic
storms, washed the sand up against the sides of the islands before
retreating. When the blinding glare of midday has passed, deep blue
shadows in the hills appear, and the country looks very beautiful.
The great table-topped hills are blood-red and blue, in an expanse
of yellow sea. Little villages are dotted about in the plain with a
few trees and some deep green vegetation in the hollows.</p>

<p>Lying between the desert and the Sudan, Elakkos has suffered
greatly. It has been a field of battle where the Tuareg of Air, the
Tebu from the north-east and the people<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_443">[443]</span> of Bornu have met one another in order to
do battle. Until the advent of the French it was considered the
legitimate playground for the only international sport known in the
desert, the gentle occupation of raid and counter-raid. The
flat-topped hills, with scarcely a path worthy of the name to
ascend the cliffs, were the citadels of the villages which nestle
under their slopes. The huts in the villages are built of straw
with conical roofs: neither mud buildings nor walled settlements
exist. The inhabitants are Kanuri, sedentary Tuareg, and both
nomadic and settled Tebu.</p>
<p>While the Tuareg and Tebu live side by side with the Kanuri, the
first two are such uncompromising enemies that they never adventure
themselves into each other’s territory. The dividing line between
them in Elakkos is sharp and clearly defined; it runs just west of
the village group of Bultum, which is the last permanent settlement
on the caravan road from Damagarim to Kawar by the wells of Termit,
where twice a year pass caravans to fetch salt in the east. They
leave at the same seasons when the people of Air, whom they join at
Fashi, also cross the desert.</p>
<p>The Tuareg of Elakkos to-day are sedentary, but their tribal
names, Ikazkazan and Immikitan, belong to noble Air clans of
confirmed nomadic habits. As in Damergu, they are the ruling class.
Barth,<a id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class=
"fnanchor">[440]</a> basing himself on hearsay information sixty
years earlier than Jean, stated that they were akin to the Tegama
people.<a id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class=
"fnanchor">[441]</a> The Ikazkazan of Garazu in Elakkos, however,
according to tradition, are late arrivals, certainly later than the
Immikitan, who live rather further east. The latter seem to have
come when the first Tuareg arrived from the east and installed
themselves in Air. It is not clear which of the two tribal groups
Barth proposed to classify as akin to the Tegama, but presumably he
meant the Immikitan.</p>
<p>The Ikazkazan of Garazu are grouped by Jean<a id=
"FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class=
"fnanchor">[442]</a> as a sub-tribe of the Kel Tafidet, probably
the, if not actually<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_444">[444]</span> the, principal tribe of the Kel Owi
Confederation. While I had no opportunity during my only too short
sojourn in Elakkos, in the course of a rapid march to Termit, to
collect information on the ethnology of the Tuareg in this area, my
experience in Air leads me to doubt the accuracy of Jean’s
attribution. It is very improbable that a section of so important a
tribe as the Ikazkazan could in any circumstances have come under
the control of another tribe within the same Kel Owi Confederation,
like the Kel Tafidet, least of all when it had moved so far afield
as Elakkos.</p>
<p>Both from Barth’s description of the “Principality of Elakkos,”
that “sequestered haunt of robbers and freebooters,” as well as
from other indications, there seem to have been more People of the
Veil in this area in former days than now. The decrease may be
accounted for by a general movement westwards, as a consequence of
the encroachments of the Kanuri from Bornu, who were themselves
constantly being driven onwards by pressure from the east, by the
advent in the Chad area of the Arab tribes from the north, and by
raids of the Tebu from Tibesti.<a id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>
<p>Barth records that Elakkos was celebrated among the hungry
people of the desert on account of its grain. The same reputation
and source of wealth continue to the present time. More millet is
grown in a limited area on the sandy plains of this country than in
almost any other part of the belt which marks the transition
between the Desert and the Sown. But Elakkos is especially
celebrated among the Tuareg all over North Africa for the shields
which are used by the People of the Veil and are made in this
country. The hide of the white oryx, which with much other game
lives in the bush along the border of the desert, is used for their
manufacture. Their reputation in Temajegh speech and poetry points
to the country of Elakkos having long been essentially Tuareg, for
the traditional shape and technique are not found among the
neighbouring peoples.</p>
<p>The strong circumstantial evidence regarding the
essentially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span> Tuareg
character of the country, is further borne out by a reference in
Leo to the Lemta Tuareg. This people, we are told, extended over
all that part of North Africa which lay immediately east of the
Targa people, from the Fezzan as far as Kawkaw. The latter, for
reasons which have been discussed, was not Gao or Gago on the
Niger, but Kuka on Lake Chad.<a id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> But there is more than
this, Elakkos is alternatively spelt Alakkos, Alakwas, and Ilagwas,
which cannot be denied to bear a marked resemblance to the name of
the Ilasgwas people of Corippus, who in Byzantine times were
fighting in the Fezzan, or in other words in an area, according to
Leo, occupied by the Lemta Tuareg. One would in any case have been
inclined to accept the tradition that the early Tuareg in Elakkos
were formerly more numerous than now, but in the light of this
additional evidence I am satisfied that they are identical with the
very Ilasgwas who came from the north, and therefore of the same
stock as the Tuareg in the Fezzan. It follows that they were of the
old Aulimmiden-Lemta stock and that they were a part of the latter
group which entered the Chad area from the north and then moved
westwards. I further believe that the Ilasgwas gave their name to
Elakkos, where some of them stayed while the rest of the Lemta
tribes went on, some of them into Air and some of them further
west. The origin both of the Immikitan in Elakkos and in Air is due
to this movement.</p>
<p>Elakkos is well supplied with water at all times of the year.
Tropical summer rains fall in abundance, leaving pools in the
depressions, to which most of the inhabitants of the villages
migrate for the few weeks which elapse between sowing and reaping
the millet, during and directly after the annual break of the
weather. As the pools dry up, leaving a luxuriant Sudanese
vegetation around the edges, recourse again becomes necessary to
the numerous village wells. They are all of considerable depth, and
surrounded by large spoil heaps, but the output is not very
copious, or rather not sufficiently large to supply numerous
thirsty camels in hot<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_446">[446]</span> weather, when each animal may drink ten
gallons or more. I travelled through Elakkos in June 1922 with a
section of French Camel Corps, and we found watering a very tedious
operation. The wells we used were 150 to 220 feet deep, and in
order that the fastidious animals should drink copiously, the water
had to be drawn at noon in a “shade temperature” ranging from 105°
to 110° Fahr. in places where invariably there was no real shade to
be seen.</p>
<p>After leaving the Bultum group of three Kanuri and Tebu hamlets,
the road from Damagarim to Kawar crosses a low scarp and plunges
into the belt of thick green bush which merges imperceptibly into
small thorn scrub and divides the Southland from the desert. The
vegetation in this zone ranges from small thorns to largish trees.
It is part of the same belt of bush which surrounds Damergu, with
this difference, that the latter immediately south of Air extends
considerably further north and forms a salient of vegetation into
the desert. The Elakkos bush is luxuriant even in the dry season,
and abounds in game. If a few more wells were made available it
would soon be thickly inhabited by pastoral tribes, now that
immunity from the northern raiding parties has more or less been
assured. It is a sanctuary for large herds of various species of
gazelle, for the white oryx and addax antelope, as well as for
numerous ostriches and some giraffes. There are excellent pastures
for cattle, goats and camels, but although some of the Damergu
Tuareg use the western part for their flocks and a few Tebu use the
eastern side, there are few inhabitants in the country at any time
of year. The surface of old fixed dunes is undulating, and in the
occasional deep hollows are a few wells like those of Tasr<a id=
"FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class=
"fnanchor">[445]</a> and Teshkar<a id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> on the Termit road, and
Bullum Babá and others to the west. The wells belong to the Tebu,
who visit them with their cattle in the summer. Immediately around
them the vegetation has been eaten bare and the whitish downs under
which they lie show up some distance away. The three wells at Tasr
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span> twenty-seven
feet deep; they are the last water before the Termit wells are
reached, forty hours’ fast marching further on into the desert. The
road, it is true, passes by Teshkar, but the output of the single
well there, forty-five feet deep, is insufficient for more than a
few animals at a time.</p>
<p>For more than ten hours’ marching N.N.E. of Teshkar, which is in
Lat. 15° 07′ 40″ N., Long. 10° 35′ 10″E.,<a id=
"FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class=
"fnanchor">[447]</a> the country gradually gets more barren, but
the character of the bush is maintained by small trees and shrubs
on a reddish ground. Then suddenly the track descends into a hollow
between bare snow-white dunes. A succession of depressions between
them is followed, the path crossing the intervening sand-hills
diagonally to their general direction. The sand dunes themselves
are loose and shifting, but the hollows curiously enough are
permanent and contain small groups of vivid green acacias. When we
first entered the dunes there was a thick white mist on all the
land and the green trees and white sand looked very mysterious and
beautiful in the early dawn. This belt of dunes marks the edge of
the desert itself. The long, buff-coloured, whale-back dunes of the
latter are covered with very scanty salt grass and scrub; they are
typical of the Saharan steppe desert. The surface is fairly good;
the form of the dunes is fixed, for the sand is heavy. The
occasional small tree is a landmark for miles around. At one point
we passed a depression with some larger acacias, but otherwise
there were no recognisable marks to guide a caravan to Termit and
the north-east.</p>
<p>The heat of the June weather obliged us to travel largely by
night, and in the course of one march which commenced at 3 a.m. it
soon became apparent that the guide had lost his way. He had
mistaken a star to the west of the Southern Cross for the one to
the east of Polaris, and was marching S.W. instead of N.N.E. We
decided to halt until dawn, but not before many precious hours had
been wasted and the prospect of reaching Termit on the third day
after leaving Teshkar had completely vanished, the normal distance
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span> there to the
wells of Termit being twenty-eight hours’ fast marching, or about
thirty-five by caravan.</p>
<p>Under ordinary conditions the mountains of Termit are visible
for some time before they are reached; in point of fact on our way
south we saw the Centre Peak at a distance of no less than fourteen
hours’ marching. Approaching it, however, the intense heat and wind
had obscured everything in a dense mist which limited the maximum
visibility to under two miles. On this day in camp the thermometer
registered 113·9° F. in the shade at 2 p.m. The heat usually
appeared to last without appreciable change from 11 a.m. till 3
p.m. Owing to the misadventure of the previous night we were not
very sure of our position, and dependent on seeing the mountains to
find our next water, which we sorely needed as the supply was
rather short. Then suddenly as evening came on the atmosphere
cleared and an imposing chain of dark, jagged peaks, with no
appreciable foot-hills, appeared suddenly in the east. The range
faded out of sight to the north and south beneath the sand of the
desert. An isolated group of blue mountains in a sea of yellow sand
at evening is one of those unforgettable sights which reward the
traveller in the desert. Their beauty is never equalled by any
snowy peaks or waterfalls in a more favoured land.</p>
<p>After crossing a narrow belt of shifting sand we camped the next
morning in a valley at the foot of the Centre Peak of Termit, near
the famous well which is reputed to have been made by Divine
agency. The water lies in Lat. 16° 04′ 10″ N., Long. 11° 04′ 50″
E.,<a id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class=
"fnanchor">[448]</a> forty feet below ground. The bottom of the
well has become vaulted owing to the continual collapse of the
sides. In the course of a week’s stay another well was dug a few
yards from the old one, in spite of the pessimism of the
well-diggers, who considered it useless as well as very tiring to
emulate the Almighty. But about forty feet down through the packed
sand of the valley-bottom water filtering through a bed of loose
gravel was duly reached. Some 1½ miles west in a continuation of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span> valley where it
turns towards the north, is another group of several wells. They
are almost surrounded by sand dunes, and have latterly in part
become silted up. Some of them are likely to be covered entirely in
a few years’ time by an encroaching dune. We cleared two of these
wells, but they proved very saline in contrast with the excellent
water of the main wells; nevertheless they were sufficiently good
for camels.</p>
<p>Termit is within the area of the summer rains, which form a pool
lasting for about two months to the north of the western group of
wells. I marched seven miles north with some Tebu who were based on
Termit for their hunting season without reaching anywhere near the
end of the range. The vegetation got scantier and the loose sand of
the outer desert had been washed higher and higher up the eastern
sides of the hills, which here extended in a single chain of no
great depth in a north-easterly direction. But I never reached the
end of the chain.</p>
<p>The foot-hills around the main peak, where the laterite rock in
places is in process of disintegration, carry a certain amount of
vegetation, principally of the shrub known as “Abisgi” (<i>Capparis
sodata</i>), together with several grasses and small acacias. We
found many gazelle and antelope were pasturing there. Behind the
rugged <em>contreforts</em> rises the steep wall of the main range
to a height of over 2000 feet at the main peak, which appears to be
about 2300 feet above the sea. To the east, behind the principal
chain and some 300 feet higher than the valley where the wells are
and surrounding desert, is a small plateau which extends for a
distance of some four to five miles as far as a secondary and lower
Eastern Chain which divides it from the desert beyond. This narrow
plateau tapers away to the north, where the two chains join one
another. It is well covered with small trees and scrub and contains
several small groups of hillocks. The passes on to this plateau
from the west run steeply up to its level; they are, in fact, the
ravines formed by the water draining off the plain, which, when we
looked down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span> it
from the centre peak, appeared to be the playground of several
enormous flocks of antelope and gazelle. The mountain sheep of Air
was also found and shot here—the furthest south where this animal
has yet been reported.</p>
<p>The rocky slopes of the range are incredibly rough. They are
entirely covered with loose pebbles, stones and boulders of all
sizes. In some places the black laterite rock has assumed the
strangest shapes. At one point on the centre peak the entire slope
was apparently covered with stone drain-pipes, whole and broken,
including perfectly shaped specimens with ½ in. walls, 15 in. long
and 5 in. to 2 in. in internal diameter. In addition to these,
plates, bowls, cylinders, small balls and tiles of all shapes were
to be seen.</p>
<p>Although capable of supporting the flocks of a limited number of
people, there are no traces of inhabitants. Termit never seems to
have been anything but a <em>point de passage</em>. It was for long
a favourite haunt of Tebu raiders from the N.E. and E., for the
road from the south branches here both to Fashi and to Bilma. There
is also a track to the Chad country by Ido well, and one to Agadem
on the Kawar-Chad road. There were traditions of a direct caravan
road from Air to Lake Chad, which I was anxious to investigate, but
the condition of my camels made it impossible. I am glad to say
that connection between the Elakkos Camel Patrol and Air was
successfully established in the course of the summer of 1922 by the
unit I had accompanied to Termit, and thanks to the courtesy of my
friend, its Commanding Officer, than whom I have never met a more
perfect travelling companion, I was supplied with full details
which I reproduce in his own words, translated into English:</p>
<p>“From Talras (an old well near T’igefen) we marched together
(two sections of Camel Corps) to the north for about 80 km. There
we were lucky enough in the middle of a truly desert area to chance
on a patch of trees, perhaps some 700 to 800 in number, where we
parted company. I marched east for thirty-seven hours and made the
peak overhanging the walls of Termit with great accuracy. Lieut.
X.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span> (with the other
section of Camel Corps), after marching thirty-six hours
approximately north-west and following a valley bed, arrived at
Eghalgawen (in South Air). I made him come back by Tanut. . . .
When I return I shall have a well dug where we separated, and the
Agades-Termit road will be possible for going direct to Chad, as I
know there is a well between Termit and the lake.”</p>
<p>In improving the water supply at Termit we had accomplished our
work. I was obliged to give up my idea of going straight to Air,
and consequently returned with the Camel Corps to Teshkar, marching
twenty-seven hours in three comfortable stages of seven, nine and
eleven hours. There we parted company. I proceeded due west with
four camels to rejoin my own caravan, marching to the wells of
Bullum Babá (two wells forty feet deep), and thence through
impenetrable bush without landmarks or visibility until I crossed
the Diom-Talras track, along which I passed in a north-west
direction. I had intended to water at T’igefen just south of
Talras, but found the wells there as well as those at Fonfoni had
been filled in. Like those of Adermellen and Tamatut, they were
destroyed in 1917 during the revolt in Air to prevent raiding
towards the south. Water was eventually obtained in shallow wells
at Ighelaf, though a violent and drenching thunderstorm at
T’igefen, the first one of the season, would have provided drinking
water had I been really short; as it was, it merely made my men and
myself very wet and cold and miserable during the ensuing night. I
reached the first village of Damergu at Guliski on the fifth day
from Teshkar.</p>

<p class="sch">IBN BATUTAH’S JOURNEY</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ibn Abdallah Muhammad</span>, better known as
Ibn Batutah, seems to have returned to the north by way of Air from
a visit to the Sudan which he made after his better known travels
in the East. He left Fez in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1351 for
the countries of the Upper Niger by way of Sijilmasa<a id=
"FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class=
"fnanchor">[449]</a> and Tegaza,<a id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> and returned to Morocco
in 1354. His account<a id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> of Air and the
neighbouring parts is brief but very well worth examining, as it
raises several interesting historical points.</p>
<p>After visiting all the Western Sudan as far as Kawkaw (Gao or
Gago or Gaogao) on the Niger he went to Bardama, where the
inhabitants protect caravans and the women are chaste and
beautiful, and “next arrived at Nakda, which is handsome and built
of red stone.”<a id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452"
class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The variants of this name are spelt
<span class="ar">نَكْدَا</span>, Nakda; <span class=
"ar">ثُكْذَا</span>, Thukdha; <span class="ar">تَكْدَا</span>,
Tukda, and by the learned Kosegarten in his version <span class=
"ar">تَكَدَّا</span>, Takadda. The latter, with a somewhat corrupt
text, reads: “<em>Takadda scorpiis abundat. Segetes ibi raræ.
Scorpii morsu repentinum infantibus adferunt mortem, cui remedio
occurritur nullo: viros tamen raro perimunt. Urbis incolæ sola
mercatura versantur. Ægyptum adeunt, indique vestes pretiosas
afferunt; de servorum et mancipiorum multudine inter se
gloriunt.</em>” Lee’s translation, after describing the arrival at
Tekadda, proceeds:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>
“Its water runs over copper mines, which changes its colour and
taste. The inhabitants are neither artisans nor merchants. The
copper mine is without Nakda (Tekadda), and in this slaves are
employed, who melt the ore and make it into bars. The merchants
then take it to the infidel and other parts of the Sudan. The
Sultan of Nakda is a Berber. I met him and was treated as his
guest, and was also provided by him with the necessaries for my
journey. I was often visited by the Commander of the Faithful in
Nakda, who ordered me to wait on him, which I did, and then
prepared for my journey. I then left this place in the month of
Sha’aban in the year 54 (<span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1353), and
travelled till I came to the territories of Hakar (<span class=
"ar">هكاَر</span>), the inhabitants of which are a tribe of the
Berbers, but a worthless people. I next came to Sijilmasa and
thence to Fez.” Kosegarten’s version, however, differs somewhat,
reading, “. . . and left Tekadda with a band of travellers making
for Tuat. It is seventy stages from there, for which travellers
take their provisions with them, as nothing is to be found on the
road. We reached Kahor, which is the country of the Sultan of
Kerker, with much pasture. Leaving there we journeyed for three
days through a desert without inhabitants and lacking water; thence
for fifteen days we journeyed through desert not lacking water but
without inhabitants. Then we came to a place of two roads where the
road that goes to Egypt leaves the road which leads to Tuat. Here
is a well whose water flows over iron: if anyone washes clothes
with these waters they become black. Thence after completing ten
days we came to Dehkar<a id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> (<span class=
"ar">دَهْكاَر</span>). Through these lands, where grasses are
scarce, we made our way, reaching Buda, which is the largest of the
towns of Tuat.”</p>
<p>Such are the accounts given by the first intelligent traveller
in Air, and they are all too brief. The two versions are not
contradictory, but in a sense supplementary to one another, and are
probably excerpts made by different persons from a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span> longer original work. The
discrepancy between “Tekadda” and “Nakda,” and between “Hakar” and
“Dehkar” are not difficult to account for in Arabic script. The
first in each case seems to be correct. Ibn Batutah says the people
of Hakar wore the veil; and “Hakar” is of course Haggar or Ahaggar,
the mountains by which it is necessary to pass on the way from Air
to Tuat; the Tuareg in Arab eyes are all worthless, as their name
implies.</p>
<p>“Kahor” is a variant for “Kahir,” used indiscriminately by Arab
writers with “Ahir” for Air. Barth’s<a id=
"FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class=
"fnanchor">[454]</a> explanation of the insertion of an “h” in
“Ahir” (<span class="ar">اهير</span>), is interesting but
unnecessary if, as is clear, it is derived from “Kahir”
(<span class="ar">كاهير</span>). These variants seem all to be
merely Arabic attempts to spell “Air,” which the Tuaregs write in
their own script ⵔⵉⴰ (R Y A).</p>
<p>Tekadda has been assumed by Barth<a id=
"FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class=
"fnanchor">[455]</a> and others to be one, or a group, of three
localities, Tagidda n’Adrar, Tagidda n’Tagei, Tagidda
n’T’isemt,<a id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class=
"fnanchor">[456]</a> lying some 40, 50 and 100 miles respectively
W. or W.N.W. of Agades.<a id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> But there are good
reasons for not accepting this identification. In the first place,
though salt deposits are worked at Tagidda n’T’isemt, there are no
signs of copper mines at this point, or indeed anywhere in Air. In
the second place, it is very unlikely that the ruler of a locality
so close as any of the Tagiddas to the important communities in
Air, in any one of which the Sultan of that country might have had
his throne,<a id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class=
"fnanchor">[458]</a> should have equalled the latter in importance;
but Ibn Batutah’s Sultan of Tekadda seems to have been at
least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span> as important
a personage as the Sultan of Air, whom he calls the Sultan of
Kerker, Ruler of Kahor.</p>
<p>The problem presented by “Kerker” is not easy, but the existence
of a district still called Gerigeri, some fifty miles east of the
Air mountains, and about forty miles north of Tagidda n’T’isemt,
inclines one to regard this Sultan, who was also ruler of Kahor, as
one of the Aulimmiden chiefs who are known at various times to have
dominated the mountains. If this view is correct the Sultan of
Tekadda must certainly have had his being some way further south
than the Tagiddas, since two rulers of such an importance as Ibn
Batutah makes them out to be would certainly not have lived only
forty miles apart.</p>
<p>Lastly, the traveller speaks of seventy stages between Tekadda
and Tuat, which is in fact only forty-five stages from
Agades,<a id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class=
"fnanchor">[459]</a> and therefore the same or perhaps rather less
from the Tagiddas, which are in the latitude or even somewhat north
of the city. Now forty-five marching stages are equivalent to some
sixty caravan days, including halts, while seventy stages
correspond to about one hundred days’ journeying. As it is clear
that he did not delay on the road, the disproportion between the
normal time taken to travel from the Tagiddas to Tuat and the time
he did take from Tekadda to Tuat makes it impossible not to look
for Ibn Batutah’s point of departure at some considerable distance
south of Agades.</p>
<p>An examination of the times assigned to the various stages of
the journey makes it apparent that in the first part he actually
marched rather faster than an ordinary commercial caravan.
Considering the actual times he employed, we find that he took one
month crossing Ahaggar to Tuat; the usual time for this section on
the Agades In Salah road is twenty marching days, and Ibn Batutah
probably took about that time, making thirty days with halts. We
next find that it took ten days from Hakar (Ahaggar) to the place
where the roads to Egypt and Tuat divided. This point is at the
wells of In Azawa or Asiu, which are close together on the northern
boundary of Air; the distance between them and Ahaggar is in fact
ten days’ marching. It is reasonable to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_456">[456]</span> assume that Ibn Batutah’s point where the
roads divide is, in fact, In Azawa or Asiu, and has therefore
remained unchanged for over four centuries. South of these wells he
had spent fifteen days in a country which was barren but had
numerous watering-points—a good description of Air by a traveller
who was used to the fertile and populous Sudan; the period of
fifteen days corresponds accurately with the number of stages
between In Azawa and Agades by any of the routes through Air.<a id=
"FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class=
"fnanchor">[460]</a> As Agades was probably not founded at this
date, Ibn Batutah in coming from the Niger would have no reason to
travel as far as the site of the city and probably therefore kept
west of the Central massifs and counted this stage from some point
west of Agades like In Gall, though the exact locality is
immaterial. South of this stage he crossed a desert where there is
no water for three days: this is clearly the sterile tract
separating Air from the Southland. The total of these times is
fifty-eight days, even counting thirty days in Ahaggar instead of
twenty; this, at a generous estimate, may be called sixty, from the
northern edge of the Southland across Air and Ahaggar to Tuat, and
this reckoning coincides with the usual forty-five caravan marching
stages to which previous reference has been made. There are,
therefore, still at least ten days to be accounted for, and they
are referred to in the passage in which he simply states that he
left Tekadda and marched for an indefinite time, making no mention
of the number of days employed till he reached the domains of the
Sultan of Kerker. I would be inclined to look for Tekadda not at
any of the Tagiddas, which are rather north of the River of Agades
and consequently north of the three days’ desert travelling, but at
some point in the direction of Gao, thirteen days’ journey from the
southernmost part of Air, or ten days from the northern fringe of
the Southland below the desert belt. I have unfortunately no
knowledge of the country west of Damergu to suggest an
identification, but am convinced that no place in or just west of
Air is intended by the description of Tekadda.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span><a id=
"app5"></a>APPENDIX V</h2>
<p class="sch4"><span class="med">ON THE ROOT</span> “MZGh”
<span class="med">IN VARIOUS LIBYAN NAMES</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Many</span> authors have assumed that the word
“Imajegh” was a generic or even a national name applicable to the
whole of the Tuareg race, and perhaps even to most of the Libyans
in North Africa. The “MZGh” root of this word, which properly
denotes the noble caste of the Tuareg, does indeed appear in the
classical names of many tribes or groups of people in North Africa.
Among these may be cited the Meshwesh of early Egyptian records and
the Macae of Greek historians, the latter being apparently a racial
and not a tribal name. The root reappears in several such forms as
Mazices, Maxitani, Mazaces, etc., all belonging to a people found
principally in the Great Syrtis, in Southern Cyrenaica, and in
Tripolitania, both on the coast and in the interior:<a id=
"FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class=
"fnanchor">[461]</a> a more isolated group with radically the same
name, the Maxyes, is placed by Herodotus as far west as
Tunisia.<a id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class=
"fnanchor">[462]</a></p>
<p>In the Air dialect of the Temajegh language the name for the
nobles of the Tuareg takes the form of “Imajeghan” with the
singular “Imajegh.” In other dialects the word displays some
variations including the forms Amazigh, Imazir, Imohagh, Imohaq,
Imoshag, etc., according to the local pronunciation. The word is
derived according to an informant of Duveyrier<a id=
"FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class=
"fnanchor">[463]</a> from the verb “ahegh,” meaning “to raid” or,
by extension of the meaning, “to be free,” or “independent.” De
Foucauld, however, gives the form of the word as “Amahar,” a proper
name having as its root<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_458">[458]</span> ⵗⵂ (Gh H), like “Ahegh,” but not
necessarily derived from the latter.<a id=
"FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class=
"fnanchor">[464]</a></p>
<p>As has already been noted, the name does not cover the totality
of the race, for it does not include the servile clans, which,
whatever their origin, are considered even by the nobles to belong,
like themselves, to the Tuareg people. The word “Imajegh” is a
caste and not a racial appellation.</p>
<p>I am doubtful if Sergi is justified in using a statement made by
Père de Foucauld in 1888,<a id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> to the effect that the
“Berbers” of North Africa generally, and those of the north-west in
particular, who are known to the Arabs under various names, used
the MZGh root as a name for themselves in such a manner as to
indicate that it was a national appellation or the name of a racial
stock of wide extension. It would be interesting to know how far de
Foucauld, after a long period of residence as a hermit among the
Tuareg of Ahaggar, modified the views he expressed in 1888. Subject
to correction by any authority having had access to his notes, I
take it he would rather have meant that the MZGh root was used in a
quasi-national sense in a number of Berber dialects or by a number
of Berber-speaking people when talking of themselves, but not in
referring generally to the population of North Africa.</p>
<p>Stuhlmann<a id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class=
"fnanchor">[466]</a> went so far as to talk of “Die Mazigh Völker,”
and stated that all the “Berbers” from Tripoli to Western Morocco
call themselves Mazigh: this, however, is not the case. As Lenz,
supporting the theory of a dual origin for the Libyans, points out,
the “Berbers”<a id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467"
class="fnanchor">[467]</a> even of Morocco are divided into two
families, to which he gives the names of Amazigh and
Shellakh.<a id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class=
"fnanchor">[468]</a></p>
<p>Hanoteau, on the other hand, seeking at least a unity of
language, says<a id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469"
class="fnanchor">[469]</a> that “plusieurs de ces peuples . . .
ont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span> oublié leur nom
national. Mais partout où les populations berbères ont été à l’abri
du contact et de l’influence arabe, elles ont conservé des noms
appartenant à leur idiome,” and he goes on to mention the various
dialectical forms of the MZGh root which he has found in different
localities. He concludes, “toutes ces dénominations ne sont en
realité que des variantes de prononciation d’un même nom.” This
certainly is so, but that he is justified in assuming it to be a
national name is more doubtful. He next tries to establish that the
signification which “some people” have given to the word Imajegh
and its derivatives is not substantiated, and that when a Tuareg
wishes to refer to a noble or to a free man he calls them “ilelli”
or “amunan” and not “imajeghan.” This, however, is not correct. The
first two words may indeed signify an abstract quality, but when
the nobles are mentioned, “Imajegh” is invariably used. Hanoteau’s
statement is misleading. In addition to the use of the term
“imajeghan” to denote the Tuareg nobles, with no reference to their
characters or qualities, the Tuareg say “imajegh” to qualify any
individual, as “imajegh” to denote someone of a certain class
either in their own or in another race. They speak of the
“Imajeghan n’Arab,” meaning the upper class Arabs as opposed to the
slaves and under-dogs of the Arab countries. They describe the
British, I am glad to say, as Imajeghan, or the White Nobles, even
in every-day conversation among themselves. It is always a class
distinction, and not a compliment, an epithet of virtue or a
national name. The dictionaries and grammars of Motylinski, de
Foucauld,<a id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class=
"fnanchor">[470]</a> Masquerey and even of Hanoteau himself on the
Tuareg language bear out this point.</p>
<p>One of the principal reasons for using the foreign word “Tuareg”
to describe this people is that they do not possess a national
name. Barth,<a id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class=
"fnanchor">[471]</a> who is a meticulous observer, makes this very
clear: “as Amóshagh (in the plural form I’móshagh)<a id=
"FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class=
"fnanchor">[472]</a> designates rather in the present state
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span> Tawárek society
the free and noble man in opposition to A’mghi (plural, Imghad),
the whole of these free and degraded tribes together are better
designated by the general term ‘the Red People,’ ‘I’dinet
n’sheggarnén,’ for which there is still another form, viz.
‘Tishorén.’” I myself did not hear these two terms used in Air, so
prefer to adopt the circumlocution Kel Tagilmus, or People of the
Veil, which is used and understood by all Tuareg.</p>
<p>Many of the Imghad, or servile people, are themselves of noble
origin, but have become the serfs of other noble clans by conquest.
It is clear that the former could not use as a national name what
is primarily a caste name to which they had lost their right.</p>
<p>The confusion which has arisen around the word “imajegh” and
hasty generalisations such as those of Stuhlmann are nevertheless
easy to understand, for a superficial observer talking to nobles of
the Tuareg race would so readily be impressed by the recurrence and
common use of the term as to assume that it really had some
national sense. But Sergi<a id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> in this connection is
misleading in citing the authority of Barth when he writes, with a
footnote referring to the great explorer and implying that he is
quoting him almost textually, “il nome di questi Berberi è quello
di Tuareg, plurale di Tarki o Targi. Ma, osserva lo stesso Barth,
questo non è il loro nome nazionale. . . . Il vero nome che essi si
danno è quel medesimo che già si dava ad alcune tribù del
settentrionale d’Africa, conosciuto dai Greci e dai Romani, cioè di
Mazi o Macii, Maxitani è dato loro anche dagli scrittori Arabi.
Oggi si adopera la forma di Amosciarg al singolare. . . . Questo
sembra essere applicato a tutte le frazioni della tribù mentre quel
di Tuareg probabilmente deriva dagli Arabi.” Barth, we have seen,
does not do so, and Sergi is making the same error as Stuhlmann. It
is true that at one point, in discussing the use of the name
“Tuareg,” Barth<a id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474"
class="fnanchor">[474]</a> goes so far as to say, “This (the MZGh
root) is the native name by which the so-called Tawarek<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span> designate their whole nation,
which is divided into several families,” but from the context and
from the passage generally, as well as from the other passages
already quoted, it is manifest that he was referring only to the
noble part of the race and not to the Imghad as well, who, he had
not then realised, as he later understood, are a part of the
nation.<a id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class=
"fnanchor">[475]</a> The context of the passage just quoted from
Barth is one in which he is showing that the Tuareg are not a
tribe, but a nation, as has already been pointed out: He corrects
his predecessors, saying:<a id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> “This name (Terga,
Targa, Tarki, etc.), which has been given to the Berber inhabitants
of the desert, and which Hodgson <em>erroneously supposed to mean
‘Tribe,’</em> is quite foreign to them. . . .” Richardson,<a id=
"FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class=
"fnanchor">[477]</a> in a previous trip to the Central Sahara
before travelling to Air and the Sudan with Barth, had already made
the same point clear. It is therefore with no shadow of
justification that Sergi<a id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> states: “Barth non fa
distinzione alcuna delle popolazioni dando il nome etnico di Tuareg
o Imosciarg, e le considera tutte come una grande tribù.” He does
nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Bates<a id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class=
"fnanchor">[479]</a> goes into the question of the MZGh names very
fully. He thinks that it is evidence “of an ethnic substratum of
‘autochthones’ of a single race.” He notes the obviously close
connection between the MZGh root used by the Tuareg nobles and the
names in the Atlas mountains on the one hand, and the root of the
Mazices, Mazaces, Macae, etc., names whose affinity with the
Meshwesh of the invasions of Egypt is also obvious on the other
hand. He draws the inference that a racial rather than a tribal
name is involved.<a id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480"
class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, some explanation must be sought for the appearance
of the root both in a Tuareg caste name in the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_462">[462]</span> names of certain Atlas tribes and in
classical geographical lists of North African people. Much as one
might be tempted, however, to believe with Barth in the existence
of a substratum of a single race, there is no real justification
for assuming that all the people using the root in one form or
another were even closely related. Its adoption may well have
become widespread among various peoples by the use of a common
language. If in its primary sense it had implied nobility or
freedom or some such attribute, it is more than likely that the
innate snobbishness of one race in contact with, or at one time
subjected to, another race using the root in this sense, would
rapidly lead them to adopt it and misuse it as their own national
appellation. I am not inclined to consider the use of this root as
evidence for anything but community of language. With the mixed
origins which we know the Libyans possessed, any other conclusion
would be dangerous. It must be remembered that there is plenty of
evidence to show that in spite of the diversity of races involved,
they had by the time of the Arab conquest all come to speak a
common language or a series of dialects linguistically of the same
origin. It is only at an early period, when the use of a single
language in North Africa was probably not widespread, that the
common root in the “Meshwesh” and “Macae” names can be assumed as
an indication of the affinity or identification of these peoples
with the later Tuareg. And at that time the names are found in the
centre of North Africa only and not in the west or even in Algeria.
The same considerations apply to the “Temahu”<a id=
"FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class=
"fnanchor">[481]</a> of Egyptian records. The feminine form of
Imajegh or Amoshagh, etc., is, of course, Temajegh or Tamahek,
etc., which is the name given to the language which the Tuareg
speak, though were it not for the physical likeness of the Temahu
in Egyptian paintings to the Tuareg the similarity of the names
alone would probably be insufficient to draw a conclusion to which,
however, nearly all evidence also points.</p>

<p class="sch">THE KINGS OF THE TUAREG OF AIR</p>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> following list of the kings of
Agades was collected by Mr. H. R. Palmer, now Lieutenant-Governor
of Northern Nigeria, in a record which has been referred to in the
body of this work as the Agades Chronicle. The information was
supplied by a learned Hausa scribe and is derived from Tuareg
sources, probably in part MSS. The record ranks as “good oral
testimony.” It was published in an English translation prepared by
Mr. Palmer and printed in the <em>Journal of the African
Society</em>, Vol. IX. No. XXXVI., July 1910. I am indebted to Mr.
H. R. Palmer and to Messrs. Macmillan and Co., Ltd., the publishers
of the <em>Journal</em>, for permission to reproduce the
information <em>in extenso</em>.</p>
<p>In the following pages little more is given than the bare list
of kings with the dates, but much of the other information
contained in the Chronicle has been incorporated in the text of the
third, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth chapters of this book. The
spelling of some of the proper names in the list and in the text
has been slightly modified to accord with the system of
transliteration adopted.</p>
<p>The genealogical table following the list of kings has been
compiled from the information contained in the Chronicle.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A great</span> student was showing a friend
over his library, and it happened to the friend to ask the obvious
question that has occurred to nearly everyone in the same
circumstances. The learned man in reply remarked wearily, that
neither had he read all the books which adorned his shelves, nor
yet were those all the books which he had read. I would say much
the same of the lists which are given below. Many as are the works
mentioned, those dealing with Air in any detail are very few.</p>
<p>A fuller bibliography of the people and places in the Central
Sahara generally will be found in Gsell’s first volume of his
<em>Histoire de l’Afrique du Nord</em> and in Oric Bates’
<em>Eastern Libyans</em>.</p>
